    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DevOps simply stresses on communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) operations professionals a.k.a sys admins. it&rsquo;s goal is to support automation and maximize predictability, efficiency, security and maintainability of operational processes, meaning you can deploy 5 times on production on the same day with confidence that all systems will be fully operational. This post is moreover a software enginner&rsquo;s point of view on the DevOps side.</p>

<p>It goes without mentioning, to build a robust architecture you will need to follow the industry standards for example, use a distributed version control system &ndash; <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> is a great one, use automated deployment tools &ndash; you should check <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a>, write automated tests using framework like <a href="http://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>, have some form of continuous integration &ndash; you can run automated tests with <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a> on different versions of a language and have some internal documentation in place which includes basic to advanced things about the codebase and the systems used. Following similar rules, at <a href="http://www.namshi.com">Namshi</a> we use some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> practices which are very helpful to us, here are some main ones:</p>

<h2>Virtual Development Environment -Vagrant</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> is a virtual development environment that works as controller to a virtual machine on your main machine. The virtual machine has all needed software stack installed, each software is installed as a config. It creates a reproducible and portable development machine which is shared among all the developers, that in turn eliminates &ldquo;Works on my machine&rdquo; syndrome and also help to get started with working on the codebase in a matter of hours compared to a day.</p>

<p>With use of vagrant, it is very easy to install new software and update them. You just add some scripts to how the vagrant box is configured and push the changes. All the software engineers will pull it, reload the vagrant machine and done. All of them have the new software and the correct version of it. As the configs, services and even file paths are shared everyone is on the same page when discussing about the system. If you are already interested in vagrant don&rsquo;t hesitate to start reading it&rsquo;s <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html">docs</a>.</p>

<h2>Atomic Deployments</h2>

<p>Some months back we used to follow a revised version of <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">gitflow</a> and grouped multiple tickets in same deployment, basically some completed tickets (generally 4-8) where merged to the <code>develop</code> branch and then merged to the  <code>release</code> branch. A tag was created from the <code>release</code> branch say <code>1.2.3</code> and it was deployed to <code>staging</code> then <code>production</code> after tests were ok. If all goes well the tag is merged to <code>master</code>. Issues with this was, if we had a problem after the deployment pinpointing which ticket introduced this issue was difficult.</p>

<p>Lets fast forward to now, currently we do <strong>atomic deployments</strong>, it means only one ticket is deployed at a time. Each ticket has it&rsquo;s sole deployment. First the ticket is deployed to <code>staging</code> tested and if everything is fine then it&rsquo;s deployed to production.</p>

<p>So, you completed your ticket all the automated tests have passed and your code has been reviewed, then</p>

<ol>
<li>You deploy it on <code>staging</code> environment after making sure that your branch is rebased with latest <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>If all tests are fine a tag is created from your ticket&rsquo;s branch say <code>1.2.3</code>.</li>
<li>The tag <code>1.2.3</code> is deployed to production.</li>
<li>If all goes well on production, then the tag <code>1.2.3</code> is merged to master.</li>
</ol>


<p>The above steps are carried out for each completed ticket. In case of <strong>atomic deployment</strong> if anything goes wrong, we know what is the cause of it as a ticket is generally a small unit of work. In both cases atomic or grouped deployment, <code>master</code> is always the stable branch deployable to production anytime.</p>

<h2>Multiple staging environments</h2>

<p>As we adopted <strong>atomic deployments</strong>, we needed to wait for the staging environment to be free to test our completed ticket(s). Sometimes the wait was more that a day if we had multiple tickets that had higher priority. There by, we devised a new way to make multiple staging deployments possible, how? The basic idea is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Deploy with a <code>standalone</code> deployment flag for the ticket branch let&rsquo;s say <code>cancel-email</code>. (Standalone deployment will mean it will be deployed to a folder on the <code>staging</code> server same as the branch name which is <code>cancel-email</code> in this case.)</li>
<li>To access codebase for this deployed branch (<code>cancel-email</code>), the software engineer who deployed will create a cookie lets say <code>staging-route</code> on the browser with value of the branch name <code>cancel-email</code> and send request from the browser which has this <strong>magic</strong> cookie.</li>
<li>Nginx will read the <code>staging-route</code> cookie if it&rsquo;s not set, it will route the request to the main staging. If the <code>staging-route</code> cookie is set Nginx will route the request to the branch name folder which will be something like <code>/path/to/codebase/cancel-email</code> and not <code>/path/to/codebase/main</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Simple yet effective solution to having a single staging problem. We are still improving it to be used in all our use cases, but the basic idea makes it possible to test multiple tickets independently and without waiting for the <strong>main</strong> <code>staging</code> environment to be free. We used <code>cookie</code> to achieve this instead of URL parameters or subdomains because we can do cookie forwarding that works for all our apps which use Nginx or NodeJs.</p>

<h2>Active logging and monitoring</h2>

<p>We are very keen on logging the events that take place in our system for example, if an email is sent notifying a customer about order being shipped, it is logged. As the number of logs is huge, to help ourselves from drowning in the text logs we use some log management and monitoring tools that help both the development team and the sys admins team. We currently use <a href="http://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a>, <a href="http://graylog2.org/">Graylog2</a> and <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a> with a mix of some internal notification systems. These useful tools give us a real time view of what is happening on the systems as well as the health report of the systems.</p>

<p>For software engineers, it is always good to know that the code you wrote is behaving properly as you expected, this is where the Reports from NewRelic and the deliberate logs in Graylog come in very handy to know how the code is working.</p>

<h2>Zero Downtime Deployment</h2>

<p>I remember the days around two years back, whenever we deployed to production it would have ~1 minute of downtime (maintenance page) for the files to be pulled and the database migrations to run and other tasks. Now, we see almost no downtime during deployments. It has been possible because of <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a>. When deploying it performs all the tasks and if all tasks are fine then just switches the symlink to point to the new code resulting in almost zero downtime deployment. For NodeJs we use <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/blog/2014/06/27/clusterjs-clusterify-your-nodejs-applications-and-achieve-zero-downtime-deployments/">clusterjs</a>, which reloads a cluster in place of restarting it and eliminating any downtime without dropping any connection, thus we don&rsquo;t need the maintenance page any more.</p>

<p>Zero Downtime Deployment in case of working system that needs feature upgrade is a shared responsibility between the development team and the sys admins team. In case it&rsquo;s related only to systems like upgrading MYSQL from 5.5 to 5.6, there will be nothing the software engineer can do while the upgrade happens, but before the upgrade the impact analysis should be done where both teams will need to collaborate. There should also be a contingency plan for rollback for each upgrade or new system deployment. Even when working for tickets that need big changes, we as software engineers implementing it should always think about backwards compatibility which can make sure least possible downtime.</p>

<p>If DevOps is about more collaboration and communication between the development team and the sys admins team to achieve higher predictability, maintainability, security and efficiency we are definitely striding to the right direction. We are looking for a <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/join-us/">devOps engineer</a>, if you think we are applying best practices in devOps and you want to join a vibrant team at Namshi get in touch.</p>

    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/08/31/php-generators-explained</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>Generators</code> are one of the new cool stuff on <code>PHP 5.5</code>, but it&rsquo;s not a new feature in software programming languages, for example it&rsquo;s on <code>Python</code> since version 2.2 on 2001 and now in the draft <code>ECMAScript</code> 6  (Javascript) specification.</p>

<p>They are a simple and powerful tool for creating <code>iterators</code>. They are like regular functions but using the <code>yield</code> statement whenever they want to return data. A <code>generator</code> looks like a function but behaves like an iterator, it&rsquo;s useful for <code>lazy evaluation</code> &ldquo;which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In this examples you would notice that we are using the keyword <code>yield</code> instead of <code>return</code>. <code>return</code> will pass value to the function caller then the function will finish the execution, <code>yield</code> will pass a value then pause the execution of the function &ldquo;which now became a generator&rdquo; till the function caller ask for the next value. Then <code>yield</code> again and again will return values to the function caller.</p>

<p>Using generators is useful in cases where you want iterations on demand, and you will end up with less resources consumption and also still the chance to send some data back to the generator function on any given iteration.</p>

<p>When you have situations that you are fetching large sets of data, you can use generators to <code>lazy load</code> (&ldquo;lazy load is to post pone fetching data till the point that you actually need it) your data sets or doing a lot of computation with big amounts of data.</p>

<p>Imagine that you have the code to execute a query on the database, instead of fetching and returning the whole data at the same time, you can simply return a generator function containing the query cursor that yields one data row at a time.</p>

<p>Speaking of Javascript, one great usage example for generators is the <a href="http://taskjs.org/">task</a> library, a combination of <a href="http://domenic.me/2012/10/14/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/"><code>promises</code></a>, and <code>generators</code> to write asynchronous callbacks as beautiful as synchronous code.</p>

<p>Finally you need to consider some stuff before start using <code>Generator</code>, beware that once it get consumed you cannot reset it, you will need to recall it again.</p>

<p>Also keep resources like db connection and file stream busy on the <code>Generator</code> function could be a problem if you are heavily use this resources and you need to release it as soon as possible.</p>

    <link href="http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/08/30/shisha-smoke-test-those-urls/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-30T00:35:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/08/30/shisha-smoke-test-those-urls</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here comes Shisha! Yet another NodeJs based application from Namshi! Shisha is a smoke testing module,
what is smoke testing? Read about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)">here</a>.
In short, smoke testing is a term coming from Electrical Engineering, where an Electronic chip is simply tested by
plugging it into an electric source and observing if smoke comes out of it! How does shisha relate to this? Well,
just give shisha a list or a file of URLs and expected HTTP status code for each URL, and it will assert the expected
status codes and show you back a report! It serves as a quick and fast testing platform for your website/APIs.
Instead of waiting for a unit or an integration test to be prepared and run, simply set shisha to run on your URLs,
it is fast and simple!</p>

<h1>Install it</h1>

<p>Install shisha globally form <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/shisha">NPM</a></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install -g shisha</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>Prepare it</h1>

<p>Create a text file named <code>.smoke</code> where all your test cases will reside.</p>

<p>Fill it as following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>http://example.org 200
</span><span class='line'>http://example.org/not-there 404</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>Smoke it</h1>

<p>From the directory where your <code>.smoke</code> file is, run <code>shisha</code> and observe the shisha smoking!</p>

<p><video width='640' height='640' preload='none' controls poster=''><source src='http://127.0.0.1:4000/videos/out.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'></video></p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>You can:&ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Pass a path to any text file containing the right URL status code mapping using <code>--smoke</code> argument</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>shisha --smoke /path/to/text/file</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Pass locals to be replaced in your text file</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>shisha --domain example.org --protocol http</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<pre><code>so your text file would look something like this
</code></pre>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>:///path 200</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Easily extending shisha in your code as follows</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var shisha = require('shisha');</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>you will have access to the <code>smoke</code> method which accepts the following arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>data source, which can be a path to a text file, a list or an object as follows:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <updated>2014-08-27T13:43:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/08/27/so-far-dot-dot-dot-so-fun</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Stardate: <strong>Wed, Apr 23, 2014 at 12:48 PM (GTM+1)</strong></p>

<p> In a cold italian spring day my phone vibrates, as all nerd&rsquo;s phones do many and many times a day.<br>
 The usual swipe, the screen unlocks and the conclusion of what started just 3 days earlier, in a rushing set of coding challenges and interviews, bears in front of my eyes:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Dear Luciano,</em></p>

<p><em>I am delighted to attach an Offer Letter in the capacity of a Senior Frontend Engineer at Namshi, please review and confirm the receipt of the same.</em></p>

<p><em>Your provisional start date is the 11th May, 2014, we require the following scanned documents in order to process your visa:
Passport – colored copy including first page, renewal page (if any).</em><br>
<em>Photograph (with a white back ground)</em><br>
<em>(Optional) Attested degree/high school certificates (stamped from the UAE embassy at the country the degree is issued and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dubai)</em><br>
<em>2 References (Names, Number &amp; Designation).</em><br>
<em>If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch with me directly.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s how it started.</p>

<br>


<p>My departure gets postponed to allow me to attend the <a href="http://2014.jsday.it/">jsDay</a> &amp; <a href="http://2014.phpday.it/">phpDay</a> conference in italy, together with part of what soon will be my new team:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TechNamshi/status/467708302143815680"><img class="center" src="http://namshi.github.io/images/posts/rasmus-namshi-scaled.png" width="400" title="result" ></a></p>

<br>


<p>I&rsquo;m right now in the middle of my probation period, a 3 months long roller coaster ride in what&rsquo;s probably my most challenging and fulfilling work adventure in my career so far and, bare with me, I&rsquo;d like to share the story if you&rsquo;re pleased.</p>

<br>


<p>In a matter of a couple of weeks I&rsquo;m finally stepping on the groud of Dubai.<br>
The next morning Alex picks me up from my hotel: <strong>Namshi</strong>, at last.<br></p>

<p>The HR department gives me a warm welcome and I&rsquo;m ready to meet <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/team/#Shidhin%20CR">Shidhin</a>, the other new frontend developer I&rsquo;ll work with, we quickly find ourselves sharing the same keyboard and pair prgramming on our 1st project.<br>
Easy welcome, really, the 1st task we&rsquo;re faced with is &ldquo;Just remake our checkout&hellip; we&rsquo;ll release it before Ramadan begins&rdquo;, states the boss&hellip; In a month!<br>
After all it&rsquo;s probably one of the most important parts of an e-commerce&rsquo;s UI, if it doesn&rsquo;t work people cannot pay and you know what they say: <em>no money, no honey!</em><br>
Peace of cake&hellip; &ndash;_^&#8217;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost 8pm and we manage to finally push out branch and open our 1st PR! Which, the next day, gets nicelly bashed of notes and comments.<br>
Kind of slapping wake up. Well, nobody said it would have been easy here, one thing it&rsquo;s clear since the beginning: no matter how many years of experience you have, one of the most important things in our job is <strong>&ndash; never stop learning &ndash;</strong>, bring your expertiese within the team but be ready to learn a lot from what it quickly shows as a really high and capable group of professionals.</p>

<p>Days go by and in a rush of javascript, PRs and more slap-in-the-face comments some how my enthusiasm grows and my passion gets refeshed. For once I&rsquo;m really feeling like I&rsquo;m back at 25, with tons of stuff to do and learn and with the push to do it.</p>

<p>Julia, code name for the new checkout, is growing fast. I keep looking at the source, amazed by what it (she?) looks like.<br>
Probably the cleanest and finest peace of software I ever contributed to at that point in time. With the dear help of Shidhin, often guiding me with good tips on the fine art of Angular&rsquo;s tameing, and <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/team/#Alessandro%20Nadalin">Alex</a> carefully preventing my bias from polluting the new baby.<br> Thanks guys :)<br>
As said, it&rsquo;s always about learning, and I&rsquo;m in a place where for once in years I&rsquo;m not the one that kind of knows-it-all. After all, it&rsquo;s what I was looking for!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s well known one of the best ways to grow is to push your self, so don&rsquo;t pick the easy task.<br>
In this spirit I blindly jump on the error handling. The catch is: the app needs to solve it&rsquo;s own errors.<br>
It&rsquo;s while working on this part an idea came to my mind that in the evening got me publish my 1st oss project since I was here and 1st npm lib ever:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/unlucio/vpo">Value Path Objects</a><br>
It happened to be the last piece Alex was looking for in order to be able to publish one more namshi&rsquo;s oss project: <a href="https://github.com/namshi/reconfig">reconfig</a><br>
Been shy at base I always had problems publishing my code, but that night I guess I got the right push and I finally did it, and I&rsquo;m glad it happened. A new frenzy grew and shortly after I had the urge of sharing some more <a href="https://github.com/unlucio/CarmenSandiego">CarmenSandiego</a>.</p>

<p>This brings us to the new moon and with it Ramadn cames. Julia is done, but since the holy month is a great opportunity for sales, we hold her back from going public. I&rsquo;m still not sure how we got it done.</p>

<p>With the 1st project reaching maturity I get the opportunity of bugging people to let me code some Node.js (finally :D). Looks like we need a 0 downtime solution for updating our node applications. A little bit of javascrit, and lots of wrestling with capistrano and the filesystem later, and <a href="https://github.com/namshi/clusterjs">clusterjs</a> is born. Published at ~1am on a Thursday night (well, actually Friday morning), it&rsquo;s the 1st oss I push in an official Namshi&rsquo;s public repo. And I obviusly manage to make a mess a couple of times before getting the publishing process right. It&rsquo;s amazing how the excitement sometimes gets you out of control.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://namshi.github.io/images/posts/clusterjs-publishing.jpg" width="800" title="result" ></p>

<p>During Ramdan me and Shiddin take the change to refine the dear Julia and as Eid cames the lady is ready for her big Debut in Society.<br> The smoothest rollout I ever experienced.</p>

<p>From that day on another month has gone by. A couple of more libs leaked to the public, and I&rsquo;m now mainly working on internal node project. <br>Everyday there&rsquo;s a new challenge and the fun is always on. In the struggles, the laughs, the shishas and the lines of code flow countlessly and every day the bar is pushed a little higher.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not always all perfect, for sure. For instance during the week I don&rsquo;t see much sun light, but I try to catch up as much as possibile during the weekends :)<br>
Living by the sea is definitely a pro, and I get to scuba dive a lot :D</p>

<p>I always hated mondays (actually now Sundays are my Mondays, crazy reverse weekend ;P) and about an year ago I stumbled on this meme:</p>

<p><img src="http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/10009391_636510409754554_1999474227_a.jpg" alt="meme" /></p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;m happy to say: <strong>I don&rsquo;t hate mondays any more!</strong> :D</p>

    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/08/22/node-file-ensure-a-small-filesystem-utility-to-make-sure-a-file-is-there</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend we&rsquo;ve come up with a small utility
that will make our life easier, and hopefully <strong>yours</strong>
as well!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We use cascading mechanisms for our configurations, so, for
example, we define the config in a few different files:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>base.yml</code>, that has all the common configurations</li>
<li><code>dev.yml</code>, which is for local environments</li>
<li><code>staging.yml</code>, which is for our staging environment</li>
<li><code>live.yml</code>, well&hellip;you guessed it!</li>
</ul>


<p>So, for example, a <code>live.yml</code> might look like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">domain</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>   <span class="s">&#39;namshi.com&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>whereas the base one has many more values:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">apis</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">version</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>   <span class="s">&#39;v1&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">domain</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>    <span class="s">&#39;api.{{</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">domain</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">}}&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">baseUrl</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>   <span class="s">&#39;https://{{</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">apis.domain</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">}}&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&rsquo;s a problem with this approach: if one of the developers
wants to change a value in his <code>dev.js</code> git will tell him that
the file has changed, which is quite annoying!</p>

<p>To overcome this we always put it in the <code>.gitignore</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">dev.yml</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and instead commit a <code>dev.yml.example</code> file that has the
skeleton of the file, asking everyone, when booting the application
for the first time, to copy that file to a <code>dev.js</code>.</p>

<p>Things work flawlessly until you need to do this 10 times
(I mean, in 10 projects, like we do) or when you forget this step
during the installation and waste a lot of time trying to debug why
the application is not running correctly.</p>

<p>To overcome this annoying issue we decided to develop a small utility,
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/node-file-ensure">node-file-ensure</a>, that
does all of this for you:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">ensure</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;file-ensure&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">ensure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./config/dev.yml&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;./config/dev.yml.example&#39;</span><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Simple as that!</p>

<p><code>ensure</code> will make sure to create an empty file if it doesnt find
the one you specified:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">ensure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./config/dev.yml&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and is able to copy the contents from another file,
like in the first example above:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">ensure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;./config/dev.yml&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;./config/dev.yml.example&#39;</span><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you need to run any check after <code>ensure</code> has run,
you can provide a callback:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">ensure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;path/to/config/dev.yml&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">src</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;path/to/config/dev.yml.example&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">){</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readFileSync</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;path/to/config/dev.yml&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">toString</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="nx">fs</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">readFileSync</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;path/to/config/dev.yml.example&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">toString</span><span class="p">());</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! Tests run through mocha and we&rsquo;ve set them up
on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/namshi/node-file-ensure">travis</a>,
to be on the safe side :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just an heads up that we are looking for talented
engineers for our tech team, and our guys are very
sad they don&rsquo;t have too many new friends!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Besides looking for a Lead Mobile developer, as we
<a href="http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/06/03/like-android-and-ios-lets-change-shopping-in-the-middle-east-together/">announced a few weeks back</a>,
we are looking for some other key figures in our team.</p>

<h2>No HTML/CSS love&hellip;</h2>

<p>Our frontend team, usually happy to write AngularJS
directives or a bunch of frontend-ish NodeJS apps,
is devastated as they feel they are missing a third
element who can help them achieve greatness.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://namshi.github.io/images/frontend-sad.png"></p>

<p>To make Lucio and Shidhin happy, we want to add a new
member in our team, a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, someone who
is skilled on HTML5 and CSS3 and knows the basics of
JavaScript but wants to expand his knowledge in that
direction.</p>

<p>You will work on a whole lot of new internal applications
as well as help streamlining our frontend processes, together
with the rest of the team: which frameworks shall we use? Bootstrap or
Foundation? How can we use Yeoman&rsquo;s generator to speed up
most of our code generation? How can we make our web apps
faster <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/critical">extracting critical styles</a>
and so on? These are just a few questions you will need to
ask yourself once you come here.</p>

<p>You will come here knowing how to design a frontend (mastering
the presentation layer, so HTML, CSS, jQuery) but will leave Namshi
knowing how to build the presentation and logic behind a full
frontend application (AngularJS, Node or something more spicy
like <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">polymer</a>).</p>

<blockquote><p>Drop us an email at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#119;&#111;&#x72;&#x6b;&#x2d;&#105;&#x6e;&#x2d;&#x74;&#101;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#x6e;&#97;&#x6d;&#x73;&#x68;&#x69;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x77;&#111;&#114;&#107;&#x2d;&#105;&#x6e;&#x2d;&#x74;&#x65;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#110;&#x61;&#109;&#115;&#x68;&#x69;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a> to apply or simply
get more informations about this job opening!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Sitting on an empty (sysadmin) chair&hellip;</h2>

<p>Look at the systeam, so sad: they really
need some new buddy for their games.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://namshi.github.io/images/sys-sad.png"></p>

<p>The chair is empty, and that makes me so sad! If only
we could find someone who would like to come and join
the hottest SOA of the Middle East&hellip;</p>

<p>So yeah, we&rsquo;re also looking for a <strong>System Administrator</strong>,
someone who knows how configuration management works,
who has relevant experience on cloud infrastructures as
AWS and wants to use some of the latest technologies, like
Docker or Deis, to help us automate and scale the hell out
of our architecture; we are trying to switch towards a more
devops oriented organization, and need someone with that
mindset to improve the current state of the team: as an example,
we use <a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a> to test some of
our configurations, and would like someone who can get his/her
hands dirty with both programming and system administration
to help the team.</p>

<blockquote><p>Drop us an email at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x77;&#111;&#114;&#x6b;&#45;&#105;&#110;&#45;&#x74;&#x65;&#x63;&#x68;&#x40;&#110;&#x61;&#109;&#115;&#x68;&#x69;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x77;&#x6f;&#114;&#107;&#45;&#105;&#x6e;&#45;&#x74;&#x65;&#99;&#x68;&#x40;&#110;&#x61;&#x6d;&#x73;&#104;&#x69;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a> to apply or simply
get more informations about this job opening!</p></blockquote>

<h2>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s crying because of loneliness or because of NodeJS&hellip;</h2>

<p>Look at how sad Cirpo, our lead API engineer, was
today:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://namshi.github.io/images/cirpo-sad.png"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that he might be sad because we decided
to use a lot of NodeJS instead of PHP, but I
think his struggles also come from the fact that he feels
we need a good <strong>Senior Software engineer</strong>, specialized in
NodeJS, who can help the team getting more skilled with
this &ldquo;new&rdquo; platform.</p>

<p>The ideal candidate would have a few years of experience
on production-ready Node systems, and it would be a great
plus if we can get someone who has a broader experience
with different programming paradigms, as we feel the most
important part of this job is the brain, and it would be great
if we get someone that has been in a few different battlefields :)</p>

<p>We need someone who first solves the problem, then writes the
code (or, even better: first solves the problem, then writes the
test, then the code :-D).</p>

<blockquote><p>Drop us an email at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#x77;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x6b;&#x2d;&#x69;&#110;&#45;&#x74;&#x65;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#x6e;&#97;&#x6d;&#115;&#x68;&#x69;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#119;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x6b;&#45;&#x69;&#x6e;&#45;&#116;&#x65;&#x63;&#104;&#64;&#110;&#97;&#x6d;&#x73;&#x68;&#105;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a> to apply or simply

to pursuit his next big challenge: we are talking
about <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/team/#Luciano%20Amodio">Luciano</a>
who is now in Spain, hacking, as usual, with
JavaScript.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><em>Lucianino</em>, as we liked to call him, has been
instrumental in kicking off
our whole &ldquo;frontend&rdquo; department, and we have been
very happy to have him here, introducing us to
the magical world of AngularJS, Grunt (even though
we now use Gulp) and Single-Page Apps.</p>

<p>While at Namshi, we&rsquo;ve seen him transitioning
from the (traditional) world of PHP to JavaScript
and even giving his very <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adamquadmon/angular-js-mobile-jsday-2014-verona-14-may">first talk at a conference</a>.</p>

<p>We really want to thank him for what he has done
in the past 12 months at Namshi and wish him
good luck for his next adventure!</p>

from Dubai.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://2014.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cirpo.jpeg" width="250"></p>

<p>Among the plethora of <a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/agenda">interesting talks</a>
there will be a (definitely) fun one, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/talks/view/352/PHP-is-the-king-nodejs-is-the-prince-and-Lua-is-the-fool">PHP is the king, NodeJS the price and Lua
is the fool</a>&rdquo;
given by our <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/team/#Alessandro%20Cinelli%20(cirpo)">Cirpo</a> who will entertain the crowd with some
details on how we mesh a whole lot of languages and platforms
together.</p>

<p>Namshi&rsquo;s SOA is currently running on at least 4 different
application platforms and Cirpo took the opportunity to share some insights
about how we are doing it: it will be a <em>hands-on</em> talk focused on
decision-making, benefits and pitfalls of running such a heterogeneous
architecture and how crazy ideas (like flirting with Lua) could be a
game-changer in your next long-term project.</p>

<p>Cirpo is no newbie to the world of speaking, as he already delivered
a few talks in the past and, <a href="https://joind.in/user/view/956">judging by the ratings</a>,
has a track record of nothing but success. Being a leader, at Namshi, doesn&rsquo;t mean
to only set the tone for our team, but also to confront with the community,
explain (and validate) our infrastructure and learn from the feedbacks we get back:
Cirpo knows that very well and this will be a great experience from this
standpoint.</p>

<p>We wish him a safe trip to the U.S. and wish <strong>you</strong> can
attend his talk!</p>

    <link href="http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/06/27/clusterjs-clusterify-your-nodejs-applications-and-achieve-zero-downtime-deployments/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-27T00:45:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/06/27/clusterjs-clusterify-your-nodejs-applications-and-achieve-zero-downtime-deployments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NodeJS has a very nice built-in support for clusters
through its native <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html">cluster module</a>:
by using it and realizing we wanted to achieve zero-downtime
deployments (ZDD) on our node apps we decided to kick in.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This afternoon <a href="http://namshi.github.io/team#Luciano%20Colosio">Lucio</a> came up to me
and asked me a simple question:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s do some NodeJS today?</p></blockquote>

<p>and my answer was clear and simple: we need a robust solution
for ZDD, let&rsquo;s do this.</p>

<p>Before jumping with our usual <code>git init</code> and <code>npm init</code>
we searched a bit and found a few alternatives, which
weren&rsquo;t exactly fitting our scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://learnboost.github.io/cluster/">learnboost/cluster</a>, which is
quite old, discontinued and hasn&rsquo;t been updated in a couple of years</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isaacs/cluster-master">isaacs/cluster-master</a>, which
seems to have a whole lot of great things but we wanted to have
the startup script as a global command rather than having to write
a script on our own (but we might wrap it, as it
has a lot of cool features, like resizing your cluster)</li>
</ul>


<p>At the end we decided to go for a simple solution after reading
<a href="http://jaxbot.me/articles/zero_downtime_nodejs_reloads_with_clusters_7_5_2013">this post from Jax</a>
that explains how to achieve ZDD on NodeJS.</p>

<p>In a few, very productive hours, Lucio was able to write
<a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/clusterjs">ClusterJS</a> and
we decided to release it to the public, as it might
be interesting out there (and because we really like
to receive feedbacks!).</p>

<p>Suppose you have a typical <a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>
app that runs through an <code>app.js</code> script, in order to run it through
ClusterJS you simply have to:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install -g clusterjs
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>clusterjs path/to/app.js</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point you should be able to see something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>~/projects/clusterjs (master ✔) ᐅ clusterjs test/testApp/app.js
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Booting a cluster of ./test/testApp/app.js
</span><span class='line'>We are gonna be launching 4 workers
</span><span class='line'>The cluster will reload on: SIGUSR2
</span><span class='line'>--- test app loaded as pid: 21543
</span><span class='line'>--- test app loaded as pid: 21544

</span><span class='line'>Worker 2 running!
</span><span class='line'>Worker 3 running!
</span><span class='line'>Worker 4 running!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Cool! You have just put your app in a cluster with four workers!</p>

<p>By default, ClusterJS will boot as many workers as CPUs
in your system; if you wanna change it, simply:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>Worker 7 running!
</span><span class='line'>Worker 10 running!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>How to achieve ZDD? Simply issue a SIGUSR2 command
to your master process, after updating the files
in your app:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>Replacement worker online.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to change the signal used to reload the cluster,
you can do it with a simple option:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>clusterjs test/testApp/app.js --workers 2 --reloadon SIGUSR1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s (basically) it! Kudos to Lucio for his work and&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;if you wanna play with ClusterJS or suggest any improvement,
feel free to have a look around, as
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/clusterjs">ClusterJS is on GitHub</a>.</p>
