            <p> Stardate: <strong>Wed, Apr 23, 2014 at 12:48 PM (GTM+1)</strong></p>

<p> In a cold italian spring day my phone vibrates, as all nerd&rsquo;s phones do many and many times a day.<br>
 The usual swipe, the screen unlocks and the conclusion of what started just 3 days earlier, in a rushing set of coding challenges and interviews, bears in front of my eyes:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Dear Luciano,</em></p>

<p><em>I am delighted to attach an Offer Letter in the capacity of a Senior Frontend Engineer at Namshi, please review and confirm the receipt of the same.</em></p>

<p><em>Your provisional start date is the 11th May, 2014, we require the following scanned documents in order to process your visa:
Passport â€“ colored copy including first page, renewal page (if any).</em><br>
<em>Photograph (with a white back ground)</em><br>
<em>(Optional) Attested degree/high school certificates (stamped from the UAE embassy at the country the degree is issued and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dubai)</em><br>
<em>2 References (Names, Number &amp; Designation).</em><br>
<em>If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch with me directly.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s how it started.</p>

<br>


<p>My departure gets postponed to allow me to attend the <a href="http://2014.jsday.it/">jsDay</a> &amp; <a href="http://2014.phpday.it/">phpDay</a> conference in italy, together with part of what soon will be my new team:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TechNamshi/status/467708302143815680"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/rasmus-namshi-scaled.png" width="400" title="result" ></a></p>

<br>


<p>I&rsquo;m right now in the middle of my probation period, a 3 months long roller coaster ride in what&rsquo;s probably my most challenging and fulfilling work adventure in my career so far and, bare with me, I&rsquo;d like to share the story if you&rsquo;re pleased.</p>

<br>


<p>In a matter of a couple of weeks I&rsquo;m finally stepping on the groud of Dubai.<br>
The next morning Alex picks me up from my hotel: <strong>Namshi</strong>, at last.<br></p>

<p>The HR department gives me a warm welcome and I&rsquo;m ready to meet <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Shidhin%20CR">Shidhin</a>, the other new frontend developer I&rsquo;ll work with, we quickly find ourselves sharing the same keyboard and pair prgramming on our 1st project.<br>
Easy welcome, really, the 1st task we&rsquo;re faced with is &ldquo;Just remake our checkout&hellip; we&rsquo;ll release it before Ramadan begins&rdquo;, states the boss&hellip; In a month!<br>
After all it&rsquo;s probably one of the most important parts of an e-commerce&rsquo;s UI, if it doesn&rsquo;t work people cannot pay and you know what they say: <em>no money, no honey!</em><br>
Peace of cake&hellip; &ndash;_^&#8217;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost 8pm and we manage to finally push out branch and open our 1st PR! Which, the next day, gets nicelly bashed of notes and comments.<br>
Kind of slapping wake up. Well, nobody said it would have been easy here, one thing it&rsquo;s clear since the beginning: no matter how many years of experience you have, one of the most important things in our job is <strong>&ndash; never stop learning &ndash;</strong>, bring your expertiese within the team but be ready to learn a lot from what it quickly shows as a really high and capable group of professionals.</p>

<p>Days go by and in a rush of javascript, PRs and more slap-in-the-face comments some how my enthusiasm grows and my passion gets refeshed. For once I&rsquo;m really feeling like I&rsquo;m back at 25, with tons of stuff to do and learn and with the push to do it.</p>

<p>Julia, code name for the new checkout, is growing fast. I keep looking at the source, amazed by what it (she?) looks like.<br>
Probably the cleanest and finest peace of software I ever contributed to at that point in time. With the dear help of Shidhin, often guiding me with good tips on the fine art of Angular&rsquo;s tameing, and <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Alessandro%20Nadalin">Alex</a> carefully preventing my bias from polluting the new baby.<br> Thanks guys :)<br>
As said, it&rsquo;s always about learning, and I&rsquo;m in a place where for once in years I&rsquo;m not the one that kind of knows-it-all. After all, it&rsquo;s what I was looking for!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s well known one of the best ways to grow is to push your self, so don&rsquo;t pick the easy task.<br>
In this spirit I blindly jump on the error handling. The catch is: the app needs to solve it&rsquo;s own errors.<br>
It&rsquo;s while working on this part an idea came to my mind that in the evening got me publish my 1st oss project since I was here and 1st npm lib ever:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/unlucio/vpo">Value Path Objects</a><br>
It happened to be the last piece Alex was looking for in order to be able to publish one more namshi&rsquo;s oss project: <a href="https://github.com/namshi/reconfig">reconfig</a><br>
Been shy at base I always had problems publishing my code, but that night I guess I got the right push and I finally did it, and I&rsquo;m glad it happened. A new frenzy grew and shortly after I had the urge of sharing some more <a href="https://github.com/unlucio/CarmenSandiego">CarmenSandiego</a>.</p>

<p>This brings us to the new moon and with it Ramadn cames. Julia is done, but since the holy month is a great opportunity for sales, we hold her back from going public. I&rsquo;m still not sure how we got it done.</p>

<p>With the 1st project reaching maturity I get the opportunity of bugging people to let me code some Node.js (finally :D). Looks like we need a 0 downtime solution for updating our node applications. A little bit of javascrit, and lots of wrestling with capistrano and the filesystem later, and <a href="https://github.com/namshi/clusterjs">clusterjs</a> is born. Published at ~1am on a Thursday night (well, actually Friday morning), it&rsquo;s the 1st oss I push in an official Namshi&rsquo;s public repo. And I obviusly manage to make a mess a couple of times before getting the publishing process right. It&rsquo;s amazing how the excitement sometimes gets you out of control.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/clusterjs-publishing.jpg" width="800" title="result" ></p>

<p>During Ramdan me and Shiddin take the change to refine the dear Julia and as Eid cames the lady is ready for her big Debut in Society.<br> The smoothest rollout I ever experienced.</p>

<p>From that day on another month has gone by. A couple of more libs leaked to the public, and I&rsquo;m now mainly working on internal node project. <br>Everyday there&rsquo;s a new challenge and the fun is always on. In the struggles, the laughs, the shishas and the lines of code flow countlessly and every day the bar is pushed a little higher.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not always all perfect, for sure. For instance during the week I don&rsquo;t see much sun light, but I try to catch up as much as possibile during the weekends :)<br>
Living by the sea is definitely a pro, and I get to scuba dive a lot :D</p>

<p>I always hated mondays (actually now Sundays are my Mondays, crazy reverse weekend ;P) and about an year ago I stumbled on this meme:</p>

<p><img src="http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/10009391_636510409754554_1999474227_a.jpg" alt="meme" /></p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;m happy to say: <strong>I don&rsquo;t hate mondays any more!</strong> :D</p>
