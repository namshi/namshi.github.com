<p>One year at Namshi&hellip; <strong>and it feels so good!</strong></p>

<p>When I decided to leave Malaysia I had several options: London, Berlin, Amsterdam, Singapore and New Zealand.
In the end I chose Dubai, or better, I chose <strong>Namshi</strong>.
I had positive vibes, so I told myself, <em>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move to Dubai!&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>In my career I had other awesome, engaging and knowledgeable experiences, but there was always a missing piece.
At Namshi I can finally say that I found the working and challenging environment I was looking for.</p>

<h2>Working on a product</h2>

<p>I think the best way to professionally grow as a developer is by working on a specific product and then seeing it evolve.
It&rsquo;s amazing how you can fall in love with it and be eager to push it forward.</p>

<p>I still remember how excited I was when we improved our API performance, you should have seen my face: like Charlie in the chocolate factory.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/one-year-performance.jpg" width="320" height="320" title="API performance" alt="API performance"></p>

<p>Of course, working on a product is not enough; you need a really good working environment and an enlightened management to complete
the scenario.</p>

<h2>A young and informal environment</h2>

<p>At Namshi I found people from all over the world and everyday I can learn (and eat :D) new stuff from different cultures.
It&rsquo;s also funny when we start making jokes about cultural stereotypes with each other.</p>

<p>Another thing I really appreciate is that even if you are an intern or a junior, you can still make a difference: no matter your
&ldquo;level&rdquo;, your thoughts and opinions are always welcome, even if you discuss with a managing director.</p>

<p>For me it&rsquo;s the first time working for a company with different teams, who I have to interact with everyday, not just the IT team (IT CROWD anyone? Well, it&rsquo;s the opposite!).</p>

<p>These are things that you can&rsquo;t take for granted.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/one-year-working-togheter.png" width="520" height="520" title="Dubai" alt="Dubai"></p>

<h2>A well established Engineering culture</h2>

<p>This is what made me choose Namshi over the other offers.
Being a good coder is not enough to be a developer, it&rsquo;s just part of the job, there is more.</p>

<p>For me, and for Namshi itself, a developer is someone that understands the domain, someone that loves to share, someone that helps
other people in the team. Additionally, someone who is always curious about what&rsquo;s happening in the IT world, someone who is not afraid to experiment
with new technologies and someone that is more product-and-customer-driven than code-driven.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we, from time to time, publicly release code on <a href="http://github.com/namshi">github</a>, or post on a tech blog or have a pull-request-review process where everyone in the
team is encouraged to take part.</p>

<p>That’s also why our tech stack evolves quickly, embracing the latest technologies and platforms: it’s like being in wonderland.
Creating and maintaining such a culture is not easy, but it&rsquo;s really rewarding (thanks <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Alessandro%20Nadalin">Alex</a> for starting this ).<br/>
As a friend of mine once said: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jakuza78/many-to-many-no-man-is-an-island-9627237"><strong>&ldquo;Lone developers are gone&rdquo;</strong></a>. You can&rsquo;t build a successful product alone.</p>

<h2>Personal Growth</h2>

<p>Thanks to Namshi, I&rsquo;m not only growing as a lead developer, but I have a chance to show other devs at conferences what we are doing from a tech point of view:
This year I went to the US, for the first time, and Germany as a speaker: it was amazing!</p>

<p>It feels so good to work at Namshi where valuable people sometimes leave the company for a new opportunity and <strong>then they come back!</strong></p>

<p>So what more can I say? <strong>Thank you Namshi!</strong></p>
