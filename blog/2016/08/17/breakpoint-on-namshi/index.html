<p><span class="figcaption_hack">Rainy days in Dubai are rare! same as good places to work.</span></p>

<p>Almost 2 years ago, I landed at the Dubai Airport on a flight that took off from
Egypt and for several reasons, a flight that won’t have a return ticket back to
Egypt (at least anytime soon, I hope).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>At the Airport I faced one issue with my Visa, and I was about to get denied
entry: Only thanks to a polite Emirate police officer I was able to get through;
a thing, I’ve been told later on, it was unprecedented, unheard of.</p>

<h3>The Oblivion</h3>

<p>Initially, when I was hired by Namshi, I was a designer comfortable around
Photoshop and Css and, eventually, I had to learn a lot more in such a short
period of time.</p>

<p>My first weeks went by with me sitting around people who were talking about
stuff I didn’t understand, they were just doing their job normally, though,
everything sounded mythical to me.</p>

<p>My first task involved creating an application that helps the Customer Care
agents to speed up the lookup of customer details while they’re receiving a
call.</p>

<p>Imagine what I had to learn, to start building an angular application while,
back then, I barely heard of Javascript as a programming language: the best I knew was to search StackOverflow to get something that would work … in jQuery!</p>

<blockquote><p>It worked, … I don’t know how, but it did!</p></blockquote>

<p>“It worked, … I don’t know how, but it did!” I said to my team mates and manager hundreds of times!</p>

<p>You might think that life isn’t easy to grasp, <strong>but Javascript is much harder</strong> from a point of view of a designer who wants to code.<br>
I kept fighting every day to get through with an output that would make me feel quite
accomplished and I want to say that, honestly, it wasn’t an easy quest (and, by
the way, wasn’t always successful either).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/gb-amino.jpeg">
<span class="figcaption_hack">Don’t leave your computer Unlocked, seriously, Don’t! A hard-learned lesson :D</span></p>

<p><strong>Bottom line: </strong> those days, I always felt overwhelmed, not knowing what I
should do most of the time; it was fun and exciting to learn but, make no
mistake, nothing is harder on a productive former-designer than seeing his
output not matching the one by his peers by any criteria.</p>

<p>The only thing I knew was that I had to push through…</p>

<h3>Light at the end of tunnel</h3>

<p>Things started to make sense: now I don’t ask “what is that?” on every term that
falls on my ears, I don’t struggle each time I want to use Promises or create a
helper function, I started to see some patterns and cling to them.</p>

<p>It was the light at the end of the tunnel, things started to make sense, I
started to have an edge doing stuff and started to believe that I only lacked a
much needed experience to be like my peers or even better, and this is something
that I’m going to compensate by an over-dose of self-learning as I did before.</p>

<blockquote><p>If he knows well , he would know that he doesn’t.</p></blockquote>

<p>That is a translated quote from an arabic wisdom saying, which describes the
situation pretty well. I just got into the surface and I thought I already
reached the nirvana!</p>

<p>I came to realize the true light at the end of the tunnel, it was something said
in one of several performance reviews that we hold on a monthly basis: ”Now, I
know what I want to know, previously I had no idea how deep it was”.</p>

<h3>Fast Forward</h3>

<p>Now, I reached somewhere where I feel comfortable to talk about the previous
events of these very condensed months.</p>

<p>I would be happy to let you know that, finally, I did it, I prevailed, I became
a super ninja full stack developer who knows about DB, Docker and knows a bunch
of modern shiny tools and frameworks, can write Javascript while sleeping as
well …</p>

<p>But that isn’t true! (except the part of sleeping :)</p>

<p>But the real accomplishment is that my mindset has changed! This is the true
victory, I like to believe that now I think, plan and decide better! <strong>That</strong> is
the real breakthrough for me!</p>

<p>Technology doesn’t matter, it is always the matter of how you think your way out
of a problem: I feel more competent with such a mindset rather than a handful of
a skill-sets that aren’t properly utilized.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<p>I didn’t want to sound self-promoting, I tried to be honest as much as I could,
but the TL;DR for my last 2 years is:</p>

<ol>
<li>I kept saying “I don’t know how to do this”, and there was <strong>always</strong> someone
willing to spend time to make sure that I got it</li>
<li>I would had never got anywhere without a team, who doesn’t <strong>patronize</strong> me for
not knowing things, they would gladly baby walk me to the point instead</li>
<li>The right people and the right challenges are things that I have a little
control over, but I always make sure I’m grateful to have.</li>
<li>I’m not the smartest person in the room, which always put me under pressure.
What made the difference, for me, is that I was <strong>self-conscious</strong> of my
<strong>shortcomings</strong>. and most of time I had a plan to overcome this.</li>
<li>I spent the first six month reading and watching courses heavily, it reminded me
of 8 years ago when I was trying to kick off my graphic design career. Let’s be
fair, nowadays, it is much easier to find the <a href="https://medium.com/@MohamedAmin88/web-designer-guide-to-front-end-stack-a8f72a2cd157#.clmhzr7rw">perfect learningmaterial</a> and this is something not to be taken lightly.</li>
<li>On my first weeks, I was cheered for my first push to live fix, which was a
really minor thing, but it greatly boosted my <strong>confidence</strong> and <strong>willingness</strong>
to contribute more. Now, on a daily basis, I tackle bugs , add features then
test them on the staging environment and single handedly deploy them live (which
I am now privileged to do!) with just an approval from a peer developer on the
Pull Request.</li>
<li>…which takes us to The PR aka Pull Request challenge: arguably, I can say that
30% of what I learnt was because of PRs; it was (and still is) not an easy job
to get approval on you PR from your peers or even worse (if your doomed :D )
from our VP of technology .</li>
</ol>


<br>


<p><img src="http://odino.org/images/meme-odino.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is one of the most common syndromes,  I-don’t-think-it-is-good-enough
syndrome  , I have been pushed by teammates to contribute to open source and
get over the shyness! this one of the things that I should have done really
earlier and, as a note to self, I should do more often :)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pair programming for the win; </strong> one of the nice perks that was a super
catalyst for improving my programming skills. Nothing is better than to think
with another mind and code together, I gained a lot by watching how someone more
experienced tackles problems and breaks features down more than I learned from
courses, reading or blog posts.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>At the end, this was a retrospective on my work/life at Namshi, to have a look
at my current pace and give myself a bit of perspective on both past and
foreseeable future.<br> My hope is that, the next time I look back, I see that I
had more mistakes, more revelations and lessons-learned.</p>
