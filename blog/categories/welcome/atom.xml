<p>Gabriel is a Frontend Engineer, who holds a B.Sc in Engineering from University
of Ibadan Nigeria.</p>

<p>He loves to build products that are functional, beautiful and easy to use.
His main focus is Frontend development (a lot of Javascript, HTML, CSS, Sass…)
and some UX to go with it (on the server NodeJS and basic PHP).</p>

<p>He loves challenging myself to do more and push beyond the limits.
His best quote is “<em>if you do it right, it would last forever – Massimo Vignelli</em>”</p>

<p>Welcome amongst the Namshees!</p>

Joe joined us a today!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="/images/joe.png"></p>

<p>Joe, from Haiti, holds a B.S. in Computer Science from NYU Abu Dhabi.
He loves building software that make people&rsquo;s lives easier, and is always looking
for opportunities to improve his programming skills, whether it is by participating at a
hackathon, working on a side project, or doing technical internships.</p>

<p>His technical skills include Python, JavaScript, C, Flask, Django, HTML, CSS,
Heroku, AWS and more &mdash; however, he is language agnostic, so he likes to use the
right tool for the given task.</p>

<p>When he is not solving technical problems, you can find him reading a personal
development book or riding a bike.</p>

<p>Welcome amongst the Namshees!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="team left" src="/images/armagan.png"></p>

<p>Time for another terrific addition to
the team as we&rsquo;re trying to embrace
the DevOps culture over here!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been trying to make some key
hires over the past few months,
and after beefing up the team with
<a href="http://tech.namshi.io/blog/2015/02/05/welcome-nitesh/">talented JavaScripters</a>,
<a href="http://tech.namshi.io/blog/2014/12/29/welcome-amin/">diligent (and very funny!) webdevelopers</a>
and experienced <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/blog/2014/12/29/welcome-filippo/">software engineers</a>,
we felt we needed to add someone with
DevOps in his blood to help our whole
team in this long, rewarding transition.</p>

<p>Without further ado, we welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/armagan_kim">Armagan</a>
from Turkey, our very first 100% turk! :)</p>

<blockquote><p>Armagan graduated from Computer Science and dove
into web development with Django, then did some
System Administration with Fabric and regret that
as soon as he met Saltstack :)
He introduced Saltstack to several companies,
either built orchestration from scratch or converted
from other tools like puppet or chef.
Markafoni, Put.io, Koding, Kartaca and Peakgames
were among those companies.
Meanwhile, he developed a video on demand Android
applications for Turkcell as a freelancer.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, best of luck Arma! And thanks for the
fresh <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava">Baklava</a>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Introducing new team members is
always a good way to end a week!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This time it&rsquo;s Nitesh&rsquo;s turn, an
experienced JavaScripter from India!</p>

<p><img class="team right" src="/images/nitesh.png"></p>

<blockquote><p>Nitesh is a quite introvert software developer who also believes has good taste in design.
He is very interested in software design practices, TDD and stuff like meditation.
He is in the software industries for around 5 years and mainly focused on enterprise javascript applications which allowed him to witness, from the front seat, the evolution of javascript from browser compatibilty hell to crazy stuff it does these days
In his free time you might find him traveling, reading books or fancy about human phycology.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nitesh has joined us a few days back and
has already showed signs of his peculiar
attention to software design and elegant
solutions, so we&rsquo;re sure he&rsquo;s going to be
having a lot of fun in our SOA!</p>
