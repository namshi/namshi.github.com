    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not really hard to believe, NodeJS is a beloved one among
the plethora of technologies that we use at <a href="https://namshi.com">Namshi</a>;
that&rsquo;s why we got people like <a href="/team#Luciano%20Colosio">Lucio</a> on board so that we
could expand in that direction.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left team" src="/images/lucio.jpg" title="Luciano Colosio" ></p>

<p>And you know what? Lucio loves Node so much that he&rsquo;d like
to talk about it at a big stage, like the one the
<a href="http://confoo.ca/">ConFoo</a> of next february.</p>

<p>Then don&rsquo;t miss the chance to
<a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/luciano-colosio">vote one of his proposals</a>
as he&rsquo;d be very happy to introduce you the history of NodeJS
(I heard part of that talk, since he already gave it internally
for the Namshi team, and I have to admit it was freaking
interesting), how it was born and what pushed
<a href="http://www.quora.com/Who-is-Ryan-Dahl">Rian Dahl</a> to write
this beautiful platform; the other talk that he has in the
pipeline is a good introduction on how to embrace the
non-blocking paradigm and he will explain how to make sure
that you treat the Event Loop responsibly :)</p>

<p>Definitely worth it!</p>
