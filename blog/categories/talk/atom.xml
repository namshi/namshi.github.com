    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/webtech14-ipc14.png" width="320" height="320" title="&lsquo;WebTechCon&rsquo; &lsquo;WebTechCon&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I had the opportunity to attend the <a href="http://webtechcon.de/2014/">WebTechCon</a> and the <a href="https://phpconference.com/2014">International PHPConference 2014</a> as speaker in Munich, Germany.
The location was very nice, and beeing a foodie, the food was great :).</p>

<p>The only small complaint I have is that in 2014, Tech conference should be in English: I missed a lot of potentially great talks because they were in German.</p>

<p>The International PHP Conference is the world&rsquo;s first PHP conference and stands since more than a decade while the WebTechCon is taking place
since the last 5 years.
The fact that you have these two events combined confirms the trend of horizontal events rather than focusing on just
one technology or product.
Lots of different topics were covered: PHP, Javascript, HTML5, AngularJs, databases, devops, systems, automation, architecture etc.</p>

<p>The concept of an heterogeneous technologies integration was addressed during the opening keynote and was a topic covered in many talks, mine were no exception.</p>

<p>I presented two talks: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cirpo/don-t-screw-it-up-how-to-build-durable-api">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t screw it up! How to build durable API&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cirpo/php-is-the-king-nodejs-is-the-prince-and-lua-is-the-fool">&ldquo;PHP is the king, nodejs the prince and Lua the fool&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>Both talks are based on the experience at Namshi, building our current service oriented architecture and API and how our stack is evolving.</p>

<p>At Namshi we believe that attending conferences and meetups is a very important as that helps the team and the individual developers grow.
It&rsquo;s a great opportunity to understand what&rsquo;s going on in our field and to meet other great developers.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s next? If you&rsquo;re attending <a href="http://madrid2014.symfony.com/">SymfonyCon Madrid</a>, don&rsquo;t miss <a href="http://madrid2014.symfony.com/speakers">&ldquo;Hey, I just met AngularJS, and this is crazy, so here’s my JavaScript, let’s use it maybe&rdquo;</a> by <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Alessandro%20Nadalin">Alex</a>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re a geek somewhere around Boston, in September,
you definitely don&rsquo;t want to miss the
<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/">PHP North East</a>
conference, which has an amazing lineup of
<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/speakers">speakers</a>
and <a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/speakers/view/176/Alessandro-Cinelli">a surprise</a>
from Dubai.</p>

<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://2014.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cirpo.jpeg">http://2014.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cirpo.jpeg</a>" width="250"></p>

<p>Among the plethora of <a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/agenda">interesting talks</a>
there will be a (definitely) fun one, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/talks/view/352/PHP-is-the-king-nodejs-is-the-prince-and-Lua-is-the-fool">PHP is the king, NodeJS the price and Lua
is the fool</a>&rdquo;
given by our <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Alessandro%20Cinelli%20(cirpo)">Cirpo</a> who will entertain the crowd with some
details on how we mesh a whole lot of languages and platforms
together.</p>

<p>Namshi&rsquo;s SOA is currently running on at least 4 different
application platforms and Cirpo took the opportunity to share some insights
about how we are doing it: it will be a <em>hands-on</em> talk focused on
decision-making, benefits and pitfalls of running such a heterogeneous
architecture and how crazy ideas (like flirting with Lua) could be a
game-changer in your next long-term project.</p>

<p>Cirpo is no newbie to the world of speaking, as he already delivered
a few talks in the past and, <a href="https://joind.in/user/view/956">judging by the ratings</a>,
has a track record of nothing but success. Being a leader, at Namshi, doesn&rsquo;t mean
to only set the tone for our team, but also to confront with the community,
explain (and validate) our infrastructure and learn from the feedbacks we get back:
Cirpo knows that very well and this will be a great experience from this
standpoint.</p>

<p>We wish him a safe trip to the U.S. and wish <strong>you</strong> can
attend his talk!</p>
