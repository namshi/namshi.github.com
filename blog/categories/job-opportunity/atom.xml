    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2016 has come&hellip;   &hellip;time for new entries in the
<a href="/team">tech team</a>: what&rsquo;s better, to start the year
off, than new faces working on a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">microservice-based SOA</a>
mostly powered by <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> running
through <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> containers?</p>

<p>Namshi is looking to beef its backend team up, with
solid engineers who can think of great solutions to
implement small, isolated, fault tolerant microservices
in our architecture: people who strive to write clean
code but also see the point of being pragmatic, who
know how to write automated tests but also know <em>when</em>
they might not be needed, who know when to abstract and
when too much abstraction is detrimental, who&hellip;
&hellip;well, you got the drill!</p>

<p>We mostly code in JavaScript, both on the frontend and
the backend, but, if you never got the chance to work with
it, don&rsquo;t worry: we believe that with the right mindset the
language won&rsquo;t matter that much &mdash; in fact, these are a few
things we care about, and they&rsquo;re not platform-specific:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have designed and mantained HTTP APIs before</li>
<li>know how to build fault-tolerance services that can run in high-availability setups</li>
<li>crunch on DRY, KISS and YAGNI (<a href="http://www.itexico.com/blog/bid/99765/Software-Development-KISS-YAGNI-DRY-3-Principles-to-simplify-your-life">whaaaat?</a>)</li>
<li>you are a detail-oriented, result-driven individual and are looking to grow in a multi-faceted environment</li>
<li>allergic to monolithic architectures is a plus</li>
</ul>


<p>We love to innovate and try to always follow the latest
trends in Web development &mdash; here are some of the things
we did over the past couple of years:</p>

<ul>
<li>developed <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/unlucio/back-to-the-future-isomorphic-javascript-applications">isomorphic JavaScript apps</a></li>
<li>deployed a fleet of <a href="https://www.docker.com/">containers</a> through <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a></li>
<li>been on the frontline to adopt SPDY &mdash; now it&rsquo;s time to switch to HTTP/2</li>
<li>have spent a substantial amount of time trying to help the <a href="https://github.com/namshi">Open Source community</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Now we&rsquo;re playing around with React Native and Redux to see
if JavaScript could conquer the mobile apps landscape.</p>

<p>Our core team is based in Dubai but we&rsquo;re open to remote
candidates: you can find more about us by having a look
at our <a href="https://github.com/namshi">open source libraries</a> or
scraping our <a href="http://tech.namshi.io">tech blog</a>.</p>

<p>If you think you could <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/join-us/">fit into the team</a>, drop us a line
at <em>work-in-tech@namshi.com</em> and let&rsquo;s make it happen!</p>
