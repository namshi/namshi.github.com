<p>Kudos to <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Mohamad%20Hallal">Mohamad</a>
who shared his <a href="http://mohdhallal.github.io/blog/2014/06/18/my-top-10-junior-developer-pitfalls/">10 most dramatic moments as a Junior software engineer</a>
in his latest blog post: the whole team at Namshi had so much fun going through
it because:</p>

<ul>
<li>we heard him shouting at Vim</li>
<li>we&rsquo;ve all been there :)</li>
</ul>


<p>&hellip;and what about you? Which ones were your biggest #EPICFAIL?</p>

<p>On a side note, it&rsquo;s great to see how passionate engineers like
Mohamad grown on a daily basis &mdash; especially compared to the
&ldquo;old guys&rdquo; like me: one of his open source libraries,
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/mockserver">Mockserver</a>,
is definitely something you should check out.</p>
