    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Namshi we run a product that needs to evolve quickly and be ready to change: new features and
technologies are integrated every week to be able to keep up to date with the market and the technology around us.
That&rsquo;s how we started using nodejs, Angular, Docker, SPDY and much more&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Do you want to hear more?</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not really hard to believe, NodeJS is a beloved one among
the plethora of technologies that we use at <a href="https://namshi.com">Namshi</a>;
that&rsquo;s why we got people like <a href="/team#Luciano%20Colosio">Lucio</a> on board so that we
could expand in that direction.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left team" src="/images/lucio.jpg" title="Luciano Colosio" ></p>

<p>And you know what? Lucio loves Node so much that he&rsquo;d like
to talk about it at a big stage, like the one the
<a href="http://confoo.ca/">ConFoo</a> of next february.</p>

<p>Then don&rsquo;t miss the chance to
<a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/luciano-colosio">vote one of his proposals</a>
as he&rsquo;d be very happy to introduce you the history of NodeJS
(I heard part of that talk, since he already gave it internally
for the Namshi team, and I have to admit it was freaking
interesting), how it was born and what pushed
<a href="http://www.quora.com/Who-is-Ryan-Dahl">Rian Dahl</a> to write
this beautiful platform; the other talk that he has in the
pipeline is a good introduction on how to embrace the
non-blocking paradigm and he will explain how to make sure
that you treat the Event Loop responsibly :)</p>

<p>Definitely worth it!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/team#Geshan%20Manandhar">Geshan</a> has decided
he can&rsquo;t stand seeing people struggling with
crons anymore, therefore he decided to give it a
shot at the <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/geshan-manandhar">2015 edition of the confoo</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to hear how Symfony integrates (so) nicely
with messaging queues and, specifically, with RabbitMQ
don&rsquo;t waste a second and <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/geshan-manandhar">vote his talk</a>
so that he can get the chance to take the stage at the
canadian conference.</p>

<p>He will talk about our <strong>direct experience with RabbitMQ</strong>,
including <strong>MQ best practices</strong> and an overview of the
available tools, so that the audience will be able to
understand the theory, see how it works in practice
and form his own opinion.</p>

<p>Well done Geshan, we hope to hear how Namshi handles
gazilions of messages in Canada!</p>
