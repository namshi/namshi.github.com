    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week one of our teammates left the team
to pursuit his next big challenge: we are talking
about <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Luciano%20Amodio">Luciano</a>
who is now in Spain, hacking, as usual, with
JavaScript.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><em>Lucianino</em>, as we liked to call him, has been
instrumental in kicking off
our whole &ldquo;frontend&rdquo; department, and we have been
very happy to have him here, introducing us to
the magical world of AngularJS, Grunt (even though
we now use Gulp) and Single-Page Apps.</p>

<p>While at Namshi, we&rsquo;ve seen him transitioning
from the (traditional) world of PHP to JavaScript
and even giving his very <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adamquadmon/angular-js-mobile-jsday-2014-verona-14-may">first talk at a conference</a>.</p>

<p>We really want to thank him for what he has done
in the past 12 months at Namshi and wish him
good luck for his next adventure!</p>
