    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Love microservices, NodeJS and distributed systems? Then we might have the right
opening for you!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here at Namshi we&rsquo;re constantly trying to renovate our stack by using the best
from the open source ecosystem: from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, our stack bleeds with
interesting tools to work with.</p>

<p>As a Sr. Backend Engineer, you&rsquo;ll be tasked to work on a spectrum of services
ranging from our customer-facing APIs to tools that power our logistics infrastructure.
We are a very pragmatic and experienced team, so from time to time you will see
engineers busy TDDing on a feature, whereas other times we&rsquo;re <em>straight to live</em>.
We pride of being a heterogeneous team that&rsquo;s experienced to know how and when to
abstract.</p>

<p>We run a Service-Oriented architecture with 100+ microservices where JS plays a
huge part: <a href="https://stackshare.io/namshi">our stack is comprised of many different tools</a>
and we&rsquo;re always up to experimenting in light of new, harder challenges.</p>

<p>Some of the things our backend team has been working over the past few months:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2017/05/28/rewriting-the-catalog-api/">rewriting one of our most sensitive APIs</a>, bringing the median response time down to 30ms</li>
<li>moving <a href="/blog/2017/02/06/towards-high-availability-and-beyond/">wonky pieces of our infrastructure</a> towards high-availability</li>
<li>releasing some interesting open-source <a href="https://github.com/namshi/stackdriver-pushgateway">backend bits</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Most of our backend apps are built with NodeJS, although some of the apps
still kick it in Symfony2 or pythonic boots. With a fleet of 100+ microservices, we&rsquo;re
generally very busy trying to innovate as much as possible &mdash; and refactoring when
we need to pay our technical debt back.</p>

<p>Understand the HTTP protocol? Like deploying microservices on kubernetes? Async
programming doesn&rsquo;t scare you? Then we&rsquo;re definitely a match!</p>

<h2>Apply now!</h2>

<p>What are you waiting for? Send your application to <code>work-in-tech@namshi.com</code> and
let&rsquo;s have a chat!</p>

<p>P.S. A few months back I wrote a small piece about <a href="/blog/2016/12/06/get-that-job-at-namshi/">Namshi&rsquo;s hiring process and <em>desiderata</em></a>,
give it a look!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re currently looking for some help in a couple areas of our tech team &mdash; why
don&rsquo;t <strong>you</strong> join us?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Mobile</h2>

<p>Getting into the specifics, we&rsquo;ve been working with an external mobile team (3rd party)
that wrote our apps from scratch, setup an efficient testing &amp; CI strategy and a
very solid deployment workflow &mdash; as a matter of fact, we&rsquo;re very proud of our
crash rate on both platforms, with android leading at 0.05%.</p>

<p>We are comfortable with the quality of our apps and the pace of development but,
in order to take them to the next level, it&rsquo;s clear to us that we need our own
team to do that: commitment, communication and going the extra-mile are definitely
different when you&rsquo;re part of the organization.</p>

<p>On the long run the team is going to be comprised of a few engineers and a lead,
so we&rsquo;d initially like to start with:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 <strong>lead mobile developer</strong>, who should ideally have good experience on both platforms</li>
<li>1 <strong>senior iOS developer</strong></li>
<li>1 <strong>senior android developer</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>lead mobile engineer</strong> should ideally be a very hands-on, seasoned mobile
engineer with experience leading / forming a team &mdash; he will need to
help building the team, setting the right direction, overseeing development
on both platforms and coordinating with other teams (ie. backend
or product management) on feature development and aligning priorities. We expect
him to spend around 50% of his time on development (this is still a <em>hands-on</em> position),
and the other 50% on the team, teaching practices, reviewing pull requests and so on.</p>

<p>We expect from <strong>senior engineers</strong> to be able to write clean, testable code that&rsquo;s
hard to break &mdash; a few years (4+) of experience are definitely needed (say, you
should have bumped into <code>@autoreleasepool</code> before ;&ndash;)) and you
should be very familiar with different design patterns (Delegate, Facade, etc),
concepts such as mock objects and various tools to support your workflow (ie. CI
pipelines).</p>

<h2>Backend</h2>

<p>We could definitely use some help in our backend team :)</p>

<p>Even though we&rsquo;re not in a rough spot, we would like to be able to expand
our pipeline and be able to add even more seniority to the team: our usual &ldquo;backend problem&rdquo;
is that we have lots of things we&rsquo;d like to work on / experiment with but not a lot
of engineers, thus we eventually end up giving those projects up or delaying them
too much.</p>

<p>The main technologies you would be working with are:</p>

<ul>
<li>NodeJS</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>Solr</li>
<li>Golang</li>
<li>Symfony2</li>
<li>a bit of frontend with either Angular or React</li>
</ul>


<p>all of these in the context of our microservice-based SOA: we currently employ
50+ service in production, mostly deployed in Docker containers through Google&rsquo;s
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>.</p>

<p>Here we would keep in consideration candidates for both a <strong>lead</strong> and a
<strong>senior</strong> position: the current team is working well and we haven&rsquo;t felt the
need to hire a lead engineer over the past few months, but we&rsquo;re open to the
idea if we find the right candidate.</p>

<p>Needless to say, both position would be <strong>quite hands-on</strong> :)</p>

<h2>Apply now!</h2>

<p>What are you waiting for? Send your application at <code>work-in-tech@namshi.com</code> and
let&rsquo;s have a chat!</p>
