    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week one of our teammates left the team
to pursuit his next big challenge: we are talking
about <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Luciano%20Amodio">Luciano</a>
who is now in Spain, hacking, as usual, with
JavaScript.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><em>Lucianino</em>, as we liked to call him, has been
instrumental in kicking off
our whole &ldquo;frontend&rdquo; department, and we have been
very happy to have him here, introducing us to
the magical world of AngularJS, Grunt (even though
we now use Gulp) and Single-Page Apps.</p>

<p>While at Namshi, we&rsquo;ve seen him transitioning
from the (traditional) world of PHP to JavaScript
and even giving his very <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adamquadmon/angular-js-mobile-jsday-2014-verona-14-may">first talk at a conference</a>.</p>

<p>We really want to thank him for what he has done
in the past 12 months at Namshi and wish him
good luck for his next adventure!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left team" src="/images/riaz.jpeg" title="Muhammad Riaz" ></p>

<p>As much as we hate to see people leaving, I think
it&rsquo;s a good thing to waive the nostalgic feelings
and celebrate who has decided to move on: for better
or for worse, each and everyone in our team has played
a key role in evolving to what I call <em>&ldquo;The tech family&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>I must admit that I&rsquo;m a bit late with saying goodbye to
<a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/pub/muhammad-riaz/10/777/414">Muhammad</a>, but I eventually wanted to do this as I believe
his mermerizing persona, the laugh, the commitment that
he showed in his 2-year tenure are second to none.</p>

<p>Muhammad has joined us even before I got to Dubai,
and left us after core contributions to our
architecture: from rushing to fix as many bugs as possible
to putting all he had in re-architecting core
components of our stack, like our main API and
integrations with payment providers: for example,
he&rsquo;s been crucial in implementing 3D-secure
authentication in our
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/innovate">namshi/innovate</a> library.</p>

<p>Last we heard is that he would have rushed to Europe
in order to join an exciting startup.</p>

<p>Bring your <a href="http://www.stylehoster.com/lpc/uploads/2014/01/Latest-Salwar-Kameez-Designs-2014-For-Pakistani-Men.gif">Kameez</a> with you man,
and remember you still have some brothers in Dubai!</p>

<p>Aye!</p>
