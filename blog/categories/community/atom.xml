    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aaaaand following our first announcement
regarding <a href="/blog/2014/09/10/what-is-frontend-first-lets-hear-it-at-the-next-edition-of-the-confoo/">&ldquo;conquering&rdquo; the ConFoo</a>,
as promised, we go ahead with the second
charge!</p>

<p><img class="team right" src="/images/cirpo.jpg"></p>

<p><a href="/team">Cirpo</a> has decided to capitalize on
the opportunity of being in the cold lands of
Canada to offer <strong>a few</strong> learning opportunities
for the attendees, as
<a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/speaker/alessandro-cinelli">the list of his proposals</a>
is quite long and impressive.</p>

<p>If you are willing to hear how we do web services
and how we integrated an <strong>API-first</strong> approach then
don&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to rate his talks, as I&rsquo;m
sure he&rsquo;d be happy to showcase our best practices and
hear your feedbacks and suggestions, to make Namshi&rsquo;s
SOA even sharper; along with these topics he&rsquo;ll be
happy to talk about some of the other tools and systems
we use like Redis and RabbitMQ.</p>

<p>But even more important, <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/register">grab your ticket</a> for the
event as I can ensure you it&rsquo;s one of a kind and you won&rsquo;t
regret it!</p>

<p><a href="/team#mohamad%20hallal">Mohamad</a>, who has been quite
productive lately &ndash; both with <a href="http://mohdhallal.github.io/">blogging</a>
and releasing some open source libraries (like
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/mockserver">mockserver</a> and <a href="https://github.com/namshi/shisha">shisha</a>) &ndash;
has decided to take advantage of one of the bonuses that
we are offering &mdash; tickets for conferences!</p>

<p>He will have the chance to get to meet the leaders in the
PHP community in one of the most amazing conferences the
PHP panorama can offer.</p>

<p>We wish Hallal a safe trip to the United Kingdom
and we hope he&rsquo;ll have a blast learning some new stuff
and seeing a new place!</p>

<p>One week ago, Luciano, Lucio, Alex and I attended the annual <a href="http://jsday.it">jsDay</a> and <a href="http://phpday.it">phpDay</a> in Verona organized by the <a href="http://grusp.it">GrUSP</a>, the Italian PHP user Group.
It was a nice experience in the beautiful city of Verona, and an opportunity to meet interesting people from international communities while attending the talks during those 4 days.<br />
The conferences were sold out, with more than 300 attendees and two tracks per day. Kudos and props to the organizers!</p>

<p>Alex and I gave a talk about “How to build <strong>durable</strong> web apis” based on our experience at Namshi while
building our Service Oriented Architechture.</p>

<h2>Join communities!</h2>

<p>Attending conferences that are community driven like jsDay and phpDay
are always a great moment to improve yourself as a developer and they give you the possibility to be part of the community.
You have the chance to understand what’s going on in our field, talk in person with other devs that maybe you just know because you sent a PR to their awesome opensource project on Github, getting tons of advices and inspiration and so on.
Keep following <a href="http://twitter.com/technamshi">@TechNamshi</a> on twitter, a <strong>new community</strong> is coming in Dubai&hellip; <strong>stay tuned!</strong></p>

<p>Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/jsconfit">@jsday</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/phpday">@phpday</a> to stay updated on when they are going to release the talks videos.</p>
