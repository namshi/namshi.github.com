    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, we are going to highlight how and why we did a solr upgrade from solr v3 to solr-cloud v6 with no downtime.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We have adopted solr v3 as our search server since the beginning because solr has a nice schema and a very responsive search indexer.
The old indexer was running on one solr server and whenever we needed to change the schema or trigger a full import we had to follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unload the core<code>[SOLR_URL]/admin/cores?action=UNLOAD&amp;core=[CORE_NAME]</code></li>
<li>Recreate the core with new schema changes, if any: <code>[SOLR_URL]/admin/cores?action=CREATE&amp;name=[CORE_NAME]&amp;config=[solrconfig.xml]&amp;schema=[schema.xml]</code></li>
<li>Delete and then then re-import all documents</li>
<li>Commit the updates <code>[SOLR_URL]/update?commit=true</code> to see it effective</li>
</ol>


<p>The major drawback with this approach is that if the solr machine down it takes time to boot up another machine and re-import all the products again.</p>

<h2>How do we handle our solr updates?</h2>

<h3>Partial imports:</h3>

<p>Happens periodically: get the latest updates from DB and then update/delete only the changed documents in the given time frame.</p>

<h3>Full imports:</h3>

<p>Happens on request or on schema update: clear the indexer completely then insert all available documents.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.employeescreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Upgrade-e1434047810231.jpg" alt="time to upgrade" /></p>

<p><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/features.html">Solr has lots of improvements</a> and by using Solr-cloud in case of any solr instance failure we are not screwed.
The new structure is a solr cluster, and contains 3 zookeeper nodes with 2 solr cloud nodes.
<img src="/images/solr-cluster.png" alt="Solr cluster!" /></p>

<h2>How do we handle the solr clients app during transition with confidence and no downtime on live environment?</h2>

<ul>
<li>We built a nodeJS service to handle periodic solr imports. The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/zindex">Zindex library</a> is used to import data from mySQL (backend source) to solr.</li>
<li>We kept the old solr server running side by side with the new solr on live environment.</li>
<li>We made a change in our product catalog API that allowed us to return a response using the new or old solr, by simply using a special parameter. This allowed us to compare results coming from the old and new solr.</li>
<li>Finally, we switched catalog requests to use the new solr one locale at a time till all supported locales were served with the new solr.</li>
</ul>


<h2>During the upgrade we faced some challenges &ndash; we are listing them below and how we dealt with them:</h2>

<h3>How to revert unwanted updates?</h3>

<p>After a full import we tried to run some validations to accept or reject the import, since <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/solr/UpdateXmlMessages#A.22rollback.22">solr supports rollbacks!</a>
But we were disappointed because <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4896">solr cloud mode doesn&rsquo;t support rollbacks</a>
We solved this issue by <strong>saving the import in temporary files, running validations on these files, then commit</strong></p>

<h3>How to swap collections?</h3>

<p>Another issue we faced was that during the full imports the product count in our catalog API decreased significantly, then increased slowly till the import finished.
The reason behind this is that we were deleting all products during the full import, then re-adding the products so solr  would show updates as fast as possible.
To solve this issue we were thinking about <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/solr/CoreAdmin#SWAP">swapping</a> but this, again, was not supported in solr cloud
So instead we used collections alias &ndash; every time we need to do a full import we <strong>create a new collection and after the updates and validations are done, we change the alias and delete the old collection</strong>.</p>

<p>```sh</p>

<h2>Get the current collection OM-1</h2>

<p>curl [SOLR_HOST]/solr/admin/collections?action=LIST</p>

<p>#</p>

<h1>{</h1>

<h1>&ldquo;responseHeader&rdquo;: {</h1>

<h1>&ldquo;status&rdquo;: 0,</h1>

<h1>&ldquo;QTime&rdquo;: 0</h1>

<h1>},</h1>

<h1>&ldquo;collections&rdquo;: [</h1>

<h1>&ldquo;OM-1&rdquo;</h1>

<h1>]</h1>

<h1>}</h1>

<h2>Create the new collection OM-2</h2>

<p>curl [SOLR_HOST]//solr/admin/collections?Action=CREATE&amp;name:OM-2</p>

<h2>Create the new data file and post it to the new collection</h2>

<p>curl -XPOST -d @updates.json [SOLR_HOST]/solr/OM-2/update</p>

<h2>Override the alias to point to the new collection OM-2</h2>

<p>curl [SOLR_HOST]/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATEALIAS&amp;collections=OM-2&amp;name=OM</p>

<h2>Delete the old collection</h2>

<p>curl [SOLR_HOST]/solr/admin/collections?action=DELETE&amp;name=OM-1&amp;wt=json
```</p>

<h3>How to do a full import for all collections without causing high CPU usage?</h3>

<p>In our architecture we have a collection for each country and since all countries share similar documents with small variations, like price, we use one mysql source and fork the backend to import updates for each country <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/zindex">(see Zindex)</a>
When we pushed updates for all countries in parallel, the solr CPU usage spiked and in order to solve this, we had to <strong>do the update synchronously with <a href="https://github.com/tj/co">co</a></strong>
```js
  return prepareSolr(availableCountries, options).then(() => {</p>

<pre><code>return co(function* () {
  for(var i = 0; i &lt; availableCountries.length; i++) {
    var country = availableCountries[i];
    var result = yield importProducts(country, options);
    logger.info(`Solr Import has been finished for country ${country} with result`, result);
  }
}).then(()=&gt;{
    logger.info(`All solr countries finished!`);
})
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><img src="/images/solr-cpu-usage-spike.png" alt="CPU usage went down!" /></p>

<h3>How to maintain solr cluster well?</h3>

<p>Just like most of our services, we <strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/">dockerize it</a></strong>. We have a monitoring script that checks the container status and another one that checks the app status e.g zookeeper replication status and solr ping, if any check fails we get an alert and apply the necessary fix.</p>

    <updated>2016-08-17T09:13:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2016/08/17/breakpoint-on-namshi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>{% img left /images/posts/rainy-duabi.jpeg %}</p>

<p><span class="figcaption_hack">Rainy days in Dubai are rare! same as good places to work.</span></p>

<p>Almost 2 years ago, I landed at the Dubai Airport on a flight that took off from
Egypt and for several reasons, a flight that won’t have a return ticket back to
Egypt (at least anytime soon, I hope).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>At the Airport I faced one issue with my Visa, and I was about to get denied
entry: Only thanks to a polite Emirate police officer I was able to get through;
a thing, I’ve been told later on, it was unprecedented, unheard of.</p>

<h3>The Oblivion</h3>

<p>Initially, when I was hired by Namshi, I was a designer comfortable around
Photoshop and Css and, eventually, I had to learn a lot more in such a short
period of time.</p>

<p>My first weeks went by with me sitting around people who were talking about
stuff I didn’t understand, they were just doing their job normally, though,
everything sounded mythical to me.</p>

<p>My first task involved creating an application that helps the Customer Care
agents to speed up the lookup of customer details while they’re receiving a
call.</p>

<p>Imagine what I had to learn, to start building an angular application while,
back then, I barely heard of Javascript as a programming language: the best I knew was to search StackOverflow to get something that would work … in jQuery!</p>

<blockquote><p>It worked, … I don’t know how, but it did!</p></blockquote>

<p>“It worked, … I don’t know how, but it did!” I said to my team mates and manager hundreds of times!</p>

<p>You might think that life isn’t easy to grasp, <strong>but Javascript is much harder</strong> from a point of view of a designer who wants to code.<br>
I kept fighting every day to get through with an output that would make me feel quite
accomplished and I want to say that, honestly, it wasn’t an easy quest (and, by
the way, wasn’t always successful either).</p>

<p>{% img left /images/posts/gb-amino.jpeg %}
<span class="figcaption_hack">Don’t leave your computer Unlocked, seriously, Don’t! A hard-learned lesson :D</span></p>

<p><strong>Bottom line: </strong> those days, I always felt overwhelmed, not knowing what I
should do most of the time; it was fun and exciting to learn but, make no
mistake, nothing is harder on a productive former-designer than seeing his
output not matching the one by his peers by any criteria.</p>

<p>The only thing I knew was that I had to push through…</p>

<h3>Light at the end of tunnel</h3>

<p>Things started to make sense: now I don’t ask “what is that?” on every term that
falls on my ears, I don’t struggle each time I want to use Promises or create a
helper function, I started to see some patterns and cling to them.</p>

<p>It was the light at the end of the tunnel, things started to make sense, I
started to have an edge doing stuff and started to believe that I only lacked a
much needed experience to be like my peers or even better, and this is something
that I’m going to compensate by an over-dose of self-learning as I did before.</p>

<br>




<br>


<p>{% img left /images/posts/arabic_quote.jpeg %}</p>

<p>Anis Mansoor</p>


<blockquote><p>If he knows well , he would know that he doesn’t.</p></blockquote>

<p>That is a translated quote from an arabic wisdom saying, which describes the
situation pretty well. I just got into the surface and I thought I already
reached the nirvana!</p>

<p>I came to realize the true light at the end of the tunnel, it was something said
in one of several performance reviews that we hold on a monthly basis: ”Now, I
know what I want to know, previously I had no idea how deep it was”.</p>

<p>{% img left /images/posts/tech-trivia.jpeg %}
<span class="figcaption_hack">One of the Code and Tech Trivias that took place recently, My team lost :S</span></p>

<h3>Fast Forward</h3>

<p>Now, I reached somewhere where I feel comfortable to talk about the previous
events of these very condensed months.</p>

<p>I would be happy to let you know that, finally, I did it, I prevailed, I became
a super ninja full stack developer who knows about DB, Docker and knows a bunch
of modern shiny tools and frameworks, can write Javascript while sleeping as
well …</p>

<p>But that isn’t true! (except the part of sleeping :)</p>

<p>But the real accomplishment is that my mindset has changed! This is the true
victory, I like to believe that now I think, plan and decide better! <strong>That</strong> is
the real breakthrough for me!</p>

<p>Technology doesn’t matter, it is always the matter of how you think your way out
of a problem: I feel more competent with such a mindset rather than a handful of
a skill-sets that aren’t properly utilized.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<p>I didn’t want to sound self-promoting, I tried to be honest as much as I could,
but the TL;DR for my last 2 years is:</p>

<ol>
<li>I kept saying “I don’t know how to do this”, and there was <strong>always</strong> someone
willing to spend time to make sure that I got it</li>
<li>I would had never got anywhere without a team, who doesn’t <strong>patronize</strong> me for
not knowing things, they would gladly baby walk me to the point instead</li>
<li>The right people and the right challenges are things that I have a little
control over, but I always make sure I’m grateful to have.</li>
<li>I’m not the smartest person in the room, which always put me under pressure.
What made the difference, for me, is that I was <strong>self-conscious</strong> of my
<strong>shortcomings</strong>. and most of time I had a plan to overcome this.</li>
<li>I spent the first six month reading and watching courses heavily, it reminded me
of 8 years ago when I was trying to kick off my graphic design career. Let’s be
fair, nowadays, it is much easier to find the <a href="https://medium.com/@MohamedAmin88/web-designer-guide-to-front-end-stack-a8f72a2cd157#.clmhzr7rw">perfect learningmaterial</a> and this is something not to be taken lightly.</li>
<li>On my first weeks, I was cheered for my first push to live fix, which was a
really minor thing, but it greatly boosted my <strong>confidence</strong> and <strong>willingness</strong>
to contribute more. Now, on a daily basis, I tackle bugs , add features then
test them on the staging environment and single handedly deploy them live (which
I am now privileged to do!) with just an approval from a peer developer on the
Pull Request.</li>
<li>…which takes us to The PR aka Pull Request challenge: arguably, I can say that
30% of what I learnt was because of PRs; it was (and still is) not an easy job
to get approval on you PR from your peers or even worse (if your doomed :D )
from our VP of technology .</li>
</ol>


<br>


<p><img src="http://odino.org/images/meme-odino.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is one of the most common syndromes,  I-don’t-think-it-is-good-enough
syndrome  , I have been pushed by teammates to contribute to open source and
get over the shyness! this one of the things that I should have done really
earlier and, as a note to self, I should do more often :)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pair programming for the win; </strong> one of the nice perks that was a super
catalyst for improving my programming skills. Nothing is better than to think
with another mind and code together, I gained a lot by watching how someone more
experienced tackles problems and breaks features down more than I learned from
courses, reading or blog posts.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>At the end, this was a retrospective on my work/life at Namshi, to have a look
at my current pace and give myself a bit of perspective on both past and
foreseeable future.<br> My hope is that, the next time I look back, I see that I
had more mistakes, more revelations and lessons-learned.</p>

    <updated>2016-07-28T09:19:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2016/07/28/my-first-two-weeks-at-namshi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On July 10th, I joined <a href="https://namshi.com/">Namshi</a> as a Junior Software Engineer. I was really excited to start my first full time job writing software. Though, I have to confess that I was also a bit afraid and nervous. Fortunately, after just two days working with the team the fear and nervousness went away. In this post, I will share with you some of the things I have learned so far as well as what I love about working in this awesome team.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Everyone is super nice</h3>

<p>From the first day I joined the team, everyone has been going out of their way to help me and make me feel welcome. In order to better understand the business as a whole, HR arranged for me to meet people from many other teams such as warehouse, business intelligence, and project management. All of those people were really nice and did a great job explaining to me how their department works.
In the tech team, I have interrupted some of my colleagues countless times to ask questions and they have always done their best to give me answers or point me to someone else who knows the answer. The VP of technology, Alex, who is also my manager has urged me to not be afraid to ask questions and discuss things with our senior engineers. In my opinion, this ability to ask questions without feeling like you are being annoying to your peers is crucial for a smooth integration of a new member, especially a junior like me, onto a team.</p>

<h3>Code quality is taken seriously</h3>

<p>On my second day, I was assigned my first task. It consisted in building a tool that could read a csv file containing a list of products and download the the image for each product from a website. This tool was for the PR department and it would reduce the amount of time it usually takes them to send new products images out to the press. Since the end users only have windows machines, the final product was supposed to be a windows executable. Because of that requirement, Alex suggested that we use the Go programming language; a language I hadn&rsquo;t used before. Ayham, one of the senior engineers on the team who was also new to Go buddied up with me to work on the project.
We started by brainstorming ideas and drawing a workflow diagram. Then, we moved to the coding part which was really fun. We managed to get something working by the next day. At one point, after making a few improvements to the code, I looked at it and thought to myself “ok, this looks great, we are done here”. But to Alex and Ayham, there was a lot of rooms for improvement. Therefore, the code went through multiple rounds of review. Each round, we were trying to make it better and better. I remember Ayham always asking &ldquo;can we do this in a better way?&rdquo; This experience taught me that even though code will never be perfect, it is still possible to attain good quality code if we care enough.</p>

<h3>Learning happens everyday</h3>

<p>Everyday, for the past two weeks, I was able to learn something new. I have learned about proper debugging techniques, Golang, how to be more productive by using keyboard shortcuts and how to break down the solution to a problem into steps before diving into coding etc&hellip; Not a day has passed without learning something new either from my manager&mdash;who is by the way an excellent teacher&mdash; or from my other colleagues.</p>

<h3>Work-life balance is encouraged</h3>

<p>We work from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm including one hour for lunch break. I often hear people say at one does not leave the office before one’s boss. But here at Namshi, that is not the case. After 6 pm anyone is allowed to go home even though our manager is still around. In fact, I have noticed that if our manager wants to discuss something with a team member after 6pm, he will always asks something along the lines of “do you have 5 minutes or are you leaving now?”. And to top it all off, on Thursdays (the last day of the week in the UAE) everyone is allowed to leave the office by 3 pm to go and start enjoying their weekend.</p>

<h3>I have one of the best managers in the world</h3>

<p>My manager, Alex, is really awesome! I’m sharing this because apparently <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/03/why-good-managers-are-so-rare/">great managers are rare</a>. The first time I interacted with him was during my first interview. I was really impressed by how he took the time to explain to me the answers to a few questions I could not answer. Then after joining, I have seen him teach, discuss ideas with, and help members  of the team &mdash;especially myself&mdash; on a daily basis.
For the past two weeks, at the end of each work day, we spend about 5 minutes talking about how my day went,  asking me for feedback for the team and giving me constructive feedback for myself. In addition to that he checks on me throughout the day to get updates on my progress in whatever task I’m working on.</p>

<p>All in all, I feel really blessed to be part of this team of talented and friendly people. I’m really excited for the long and fun road ahead.</p>

<p>If this blog post got you excited about the prospect of joining our team, please do send in an application as we are currently hiring :)</p>
