    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NodeJS has a very nice built-in support for clusters
through its native <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html">cluster module</a>:
by using it and realizing we wanted to achieve zero-downtime
deployments (ZDD) on our node apps we decided to kick in.</p>

<p>This afternoon <a href="/team#Luciano%20Colosio">Lucio</a> came up to me
and asked me a simple question:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s do some NodeJS today?</p></blockquote>

<p>and my answer was clear and simple: we need a robust solution
for ZDD, let&rsquo;s do this.</p>

<p>Before jumping with our usual <code>git init</code> and <code>npm init</code>
we searched a bit and found a few alternatives, which
weren&rsquo;t exactly fitting our scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://learnboost.github.io/cluster/">learnboost/cluster</a>, which is
quite old, discontinued and hasn&rsquo;t been updated in a couple of years</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isaacs/cluster-master">isaacs/cluster-master</a>, which
seems to have a whole lot of great things but we wanted to have
the startup script as a global command rather than having to write
a script on our own (but we might wrap it, as it
has a lot of cool features, like resizing your cluster)</li>
</ul>


<p>At the end we decided to go for a simple solution after reading
<a href="http://jaxbot.me/articles/zero_downtime_nodejs_reloads_with_clusters_7_5_2013">this post from Jax</a>
that explains how to achieve ZDD on NodeJS.</p>

<p>In a few, very productive hours, Lucio was able to write
<a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/clusterjs">ClusterJS</a> and
we decided to release it to the public, as it might
be interesting out there (and because we really like
to receive feedbacks!).</p>

<p>Suppose you have a typical <a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>
app that runs through an <code>app.js</code> script, in order to run it through
ClusterJS you simply have to:</p>

<p>```
npm install -g clusterjs</p>

<p>clusterjs path/to/app.js
```</p>

<p>At this point you should be able to see something like this:</p>

<p>```
~/projects/clusterjs (master ✔) ᐅ clusterjs test/testApp/app.js</p>

<p>Booting a cluster of ./test/testApp/app.js
We are gonna be launching 4 workers
The cluster will reload on: SIGUSR2
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21543
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21544
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21546
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21547
Worker 1 running!
Worker 2 running!
Worker 3 running!
Worker 4 running!
```</p>

<p>Cool! You have just put your app in a cluster with four workers!</p>

<p>By default, ClusterJS will boot as many workers as CPUs
in your system; if you wanna change it, simply:</p>

<p>```
~/projects/clusterjs (master ✔) ᐅ clusterjs test/testApp/app.js &mdash;workers 10</p>

<p>Booting a cluster of ./test/testApp/app.js
We are gonna be launching 10 workers
The cluster will reload on: SIGUSR2
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21636
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21635
Worker 2 running!
Worker 1 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21650
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21640
Worker 9 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21639
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21641
Worker 4 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21644
Worker 5 running!
Worker 3 running!
Worker 6 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21648
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21646
Worker 8 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21652
Worker 7 running!
Worker 10 running!
```</p>

<p>How to achieve ZDD? Simply issue a SIGUSR2 command
to your master process, after updating the files
in your app:</p>

<p>```
~/projects/clusterjs (master ✔) ᐅ clusterjs test/testApp/app.js &mdash;workers 2
Booting a cluster of ./test/testApp/app.js
We are gonna be launching 2 workers
The cluster will reload on: SIGUSR2
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22007
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22008
Worker 1 running!
Worker 2 running!</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 received, reloading the app
<strong><em> reloading workers!
restarting worker: 1
Shutdown complete for worker 1
Worker 1 died :(
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22018
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22021
Worker 3 running!
Worker 4 running!
Replacement worker online.
</em></strong> reloading workers!
restarting worker: 2
Shutdown complete for worker 2
Worker 2 died :(
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22055
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22056
Worker 5 running!
Worker 6 running!
Replacement worker online.
```</p>

<p>If you want to change the signal used to reload the cluster,
you can do it with a simple option:</p>

<p><code>
clusterjs test/testApp/app.js --workers 2 --reloadon SIGUSR1
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s (basically) it! Kudos to Lucio for his work and&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;if you wanna play with ClusterJS or suggest any improvement,
feel free to have a look around, as
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/clusterjs">ClusterJS is on GitHub</a>.</p>
