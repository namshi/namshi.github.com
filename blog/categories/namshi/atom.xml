    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just an heads up that we are looking for talented
engineers for our tech team, and our guys are very
sad they don&rsquo;t have too many new friends!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Besides looking for a Lead Mobile developer, as we
<a href="/blog/2014/06/03/like-android-and-ios-lets-change-shopping-in-the-middle-east-together/">announced a few weeks back</a>,
we are looking for some other key figures in our team.</p>

<h2>No HTML/CSS love&hellip;</h2>

<p>Our frontend team, usually happy to write AngularJS
directives or a bunch of frontend-ish NodeJS apps,
is devastated as they feel they are missing a third
element who can help them achieve greatness.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/frontend-sad.png %}</p>

<p>To make Lucio and Shidhin happy, we want to add a new
member in our team, a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, someone who
is skilled on HTML5 and CSS3 and knows the basics of
JavaScript but wants to expand his knowledge in that
direction.</p>

<p>You will work on a whole lot of new internal applications
as well as help streamlining our frontend processes, together
with the rest of the team: which frameworks shall we use? Bootstrap or
Foundation? How can we use Yeoman&rsquo;s generator to speed up
most of our code generation? How can we make our web apps
faster <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/critical">extracting critical styles</a>
and so on? These are just a few questions you will need to
ask yourself once you come here.</p>

<p>You will come here knowing how to design a frontend (mastering
the presentation layer, so HTML, CSS, jQuery) but will leave Namshi
knowing how to build the presentation and logic behind a full
frontend application (AngularJS, Node or something more spicy
like <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">polymer</a>).</p>

get more informations about this job opening!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Sitting on an empty (sysadmin) chair&hellip;</h2>

<p>Look at the systeam, so sad: they really
need some new buddy for their games.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/sys-sad.png %}</p>

<p>The chair is empty, and that makes me so sad! If only
we could find someone who would like to come and join
the hottest SOA of the Middle East&hellip;</p>

<p>So yeah, we&rsquo;re also looking for a <strong>System Administrator</strong>,
someone who knows how configuration management works,
who has relevant experience on cloud infrastructures as
AWS and wants to use some of the latest technologies, like
Docker or Deis, to help us automate and scale the hell out
of our architecture; we are trying to switch towards a more
devops oriented organization, and need someone with that
mindset to improve the current state of the team: as an example,
we use <a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a> to test some of
our configurations, and would like someone who can get his/her
hands dirty with both programming and system administration
to help the team.</p>

<blockquote><p>Drop us an email at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x77;&#111;&#114;&#x6b;&#x2d;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x2d;&#x74;&#x65;&#99;&#x68;&#64;&#x6e;&#97;&#x6d;&#x73;&#x68;&#x69;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x77;&#111;&#x72;&#107;&#x2d;&#105;&#x6e;&#x2d;&#x74;&#x65;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x6d;&#115;&#104;&#x69;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a> to apply or simply

<h2>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s crying because of loneliness or because of NodeJS&hellip;</h2>

<p>Look at how sad Cirpo, our lead API engineer, was
today:</p>

<p>{% img center /images/cirpo-sad.png %}</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that he might be sad because we decided
to use a lot of NodeJS instead of PHP, but I
think his struggles also come from the fact that he feels
we need a good <strong>Senior Software engineer</strong>, specialized in
NodeJS, who can help the team getting more skilled with
this &ldquo;new&rdquo; platform.</p>

<p>The ideal candidate would have a few years of experience
on production-ready Node systems, and it would be a great
plus if we can get someone who has a broader experience
with different programming paradigms, as we feel the most
important part of this job is the brain, and it would be great
if we get someone that has been in a few different battlefields :)</p>

<p>We need someone who first solves the problem, then writes the
code (or, even better: first solves the problem, then writes the
test, then the code :-D).</p>

<blockquote><p>Drop us an email at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#119;&#x6f;&#114;&#x6b;&#x2d;&#105;&#x6e;&#45;&#x74;&#101;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x6d;&#x73;&#x68;&#x69;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#119;&#x6f;&#114;&#x6b;&#45;&#105;&#x6e;&#x2d;&#116;&#101;&#x63;&#x68;&#64;&#x6e;&#97;&#109;&#x73;&#104;&#105;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a> to apply or simply

    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/06/27/clusterjs-clusterify-your-nodejs-applications-and-achieve-zero-downtime-deployments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NodeJS has a very nice built-in support for clusters
through its native <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html">cluster module</a>:
by using it and realizing we wanted to achieve zero-downtime
deployments (ZDD) on our node apps we decided to kick in.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This afternoon <a href="/team#Luciano%20Colosio">Lucio</a> came up to me
and asked me a simple question:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s do some NodeJS today?</p></blockquote>

<p>and my answer was clear and simple: we need a robust solution
for ZDD, let&rsquo;s do this.</p>

<p>Before jumping with our usual <code>git init</code> and <code>npm init</code>
we searched a bit and found a few alternatives, which
weren&rsquo;t exactly fitting our scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://learnboost.github.io/cluster/">learnboost/cluster</a>, which is
quite old, discontinued and hasn&rsquo;t been updated in a couple of years</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isaacs/cluster-master">isaacs/cluster-master</a>, which
seems to have a whole lot of great things but we wanted to have
the startup script as a global command rather than having to write
a script on our own (but we might wrap it, as it
has a lot of cool features, like resizing your cluster)</li>
</ul>


<p>At the end we decided to go for a simple solution after reading
<a href="http://jaxbot.me/articles/zero_downtime_nodejs_reloads_with_clusters_7_5_2013">this post from Jax</a>
that explains how to achieve ZDD on NodeJS.</p>

<p>In a few, very productive hours, Lucio was able to write
<a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/clusterjs">ClusterJS</a> and
we decided to release it to the public, as it might
be interesting out there (and because we really like
to receive feedbacks!).</p>

<p>Suppose you have a typical <a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>
app that runs through an <code>app.js</code> script, in order to run it through
ClusterJS you simply have to:</p>

<p>```
npm install -g clusterjs</p>

<p>clusterjs path/to/app.js
```</p>

<p>At this point you should be able to see something like this:</p>

<p>```
~/projects/clusterjs (master ✔) ᐅ clusterjs test/testApp/app.js</p>

<p>Booting a cluster of ./test/testApp/app.js
We are gonna be launching 4 workers
The cluster will reload on: SIGUSR2
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21543
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21544
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21546
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21547
Worker 1 running!
Worker 2 running!
Worker 3 running!
Worker 4 running!
```</p>

<p>Cool! You have just put your app in a cluster with four workers!</p>

<p>By default, ClusterJS will boot as many workers as CPUs
in your system; if you wanna change it, simply:</p>

<p>```
~/projects/clusterjs (master ✔) ᐅ clusterjs test/testApp/app.js &mdash;workers 10</p>

<p>Booting a cluster of ./test/testApp/app.js
We are gonna be launching 10 workers
The cluster will reload on: SIGUSR2
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21636
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21635
Worker 2 running!
Worker 1 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21650
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21640
Worker 9 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21639
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21641
Worker 4 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21644
Worker 5 running!
Worker 3 running!
Worker 6 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21648
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21646
Worker 8 running!
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 21652
Worker 7 running!
Worker 10 running!
```</p>

<p>How to achieve ZDD? Simply issue a SIGUSR2 command
to your master process, after updating the files
in your app:</p>

<p>```
~/projects/clusterjs (master ✔) ᐅ clusterjs test/testApp/app.js &mdash;workers 2
Booting a cluster of ./test/testApp/app.js
We are gonna be launching 2 workers
The cluster will reload on: SIGUSR2
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22007
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22008
Worker 1 running!
Worker 2 running!</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 received, reloading the app
<strong><em> reloading workers!
restarting worker: 1
Shutdown complete for worker 1
Worker 1 died :(
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22018
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22021
Worker 3 running!
Worker 4 running!
Replacement worker online.
</em></strong> reloading workers!
restarting worker: 2
Shutdown complete for worker 2
Worker 2 died :(
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22055
&mdash;&ndash; test app loaded as pid: 22056
Worker 5 running!
Worker 6 running!
Replacement worker online.
```</p>

<p>If you want to change the signal used to reload the cluster,
you can do it with a simple option:</p>

<p><code>
clusterjs test/testApp/app.js --workers 2 --reloadon SIGUSR1
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s (basically) it! Kudos to Lucio for his work and&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;if you wanna play with ClusterJS or suggest any improvement,
feel free to have a look around, as
<a href="https://github.com/namshi/clusterjs">ClusterJS is on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>Our GIT flow</h3>

<p>Git is so powerful and flexible that at the beginning you feel kinda lost: <em>&ldquo;How should I use it?&rdquo;</em>  <em>&ldquo;Should I use merge or rebase?&rdquo;</em>  <em>&ldquo;master, develop, release branches?&rdquo;</em>
And then you try to find the answer via google and you find the solution: <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">&ldquo;GIT FLOW!&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>No, no, and again <strong>NO!</strong> (please say it out loud).</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Git flow&rdquo; is one of several ways to use git, but it&rsquo;s not a standard and it could not fit well in your current organisation/codebase/team flow.</p>

<p>You should embrace the power of git, and find a tailor-made solution.</p>

<p>At Namshi we basically have two main branches: master and develop.</p>

<p>On master you have, exactly, what&rsquo;s running on production, while develop is our development branch (surprisingly).</p>

<p>When we pick a task we usually create a branch from develop. Once we are done with a task we rebase our feature branch from develop, in order to be sure that the new
code works and doesn&rsquo;t break anything before being merged in develop. Then we open a pull request (PR) on Github. Once the PR is reviewed and approved
it gets merged in the develop branch.
There is (still) a lot of discussion (and flames) about using the rebase command, because basically it rewrites the current commits history.
It&rsquo;s true that potentially you can screw your codebase, but we are still safe because you can still rely on your teammates local repositories and
gain from the integrity, stability (before merging on the develop branch you can be sure that you didn&rsquo;t break anything) and clean commits history point of view.</p>

<p>Once we decide that we can ship new stuff, we create a new branch (usually a release branch), tag it, deploy on staging and then deploy on live.
Then we merge the tag on master (with the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html">&mdash;no-ff option</a> and rebase develop with master.
Even here we use the rebase command because we end up with develop that has the same commits sequence as master plus new commits: it&rsquo;s so easy to spot the differences between the two branches.</p>

<h3>Git Config</h3>

<p>There are several configuration settings that you can put in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file and get a lot of benefits on your daily git usage.</p>

<h4>colors</h4>

<p>Give some love to git outputs:</p>

<p><code>
git config --global color.ui true
</code></p>

<h4>filemode</h4>

<p>Tired of having weird a <code>git status</code> output because some files has just changed file permissions?
<code>
git config --global core.filemode false
</code></p>

<h4>rerere</h4>

<p>The git rerere functionality stands for <em>&ldquo;reuse recorded resolution&rdquo;</em> and as the name implies, it allows you to ask git to remember how you&rsquo;ve resolved a knotty conflict so that the next time you have the same conflict, git can automatically resolve it for you.
<code>
git config --global rerere.enabled true
</code></p>

<h4>global exclude</h4>

<p>Instead of setting common files to be ignored in your local .gitignore file (i.e. your IDE config file, .DS_Store etc) everytime, you can use a global ignore file
that will automatically apply to all your repos.
<code>
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
</code>
<strong>tip:</strong> I have a <code>my_temp</code> entry in my .gitignore global file, so that I can create a <code>my_temp</code> dir in my working copies and be free to put any experimental and temporary code/quick testing code
in it without changing the project on my IDE and using the actual codebase.</p>

<h4>pull with rebase, not merge</h4>

<p>Everytime we pull from a remote repository, we do a <code>git pull --rebase</code> because we don&rsquo;t want to mess up with our local commits.
Instead of specifying it everytime, you can make it the default beaviour when you pull:
<code>
git config --global branch.auto-setuprebase always
</code></p>

<h4>autocorrect</h4>

<p>Git can autocorrect you:</p>

<p><code>
git config --global help.autocorrect true
</code></p>

<p>```
➜  namshi.github.com git:(source) ✗ git cmmit
git: &lsquo;cmmit&rsquo; is not a git command. See &lsquo;git &mdash;help&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Did you mean this?</p>

<pre><code>commit
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h4>default tracking</h4>

<p>Bored of setting up branch tracking by hand?
<code>
git config --global push.default upstream
</code></p>

<h3>Git aliases</h3>

<p>Git supports aliases via the <code>git config --global alias.&lt;alias_name&gt; "&lt;git command&gt;"</code>, but here in Namshi we tend to use the shell aliases
because you can save even more chars and git is the only revision control and source code management system we use.</p>

<h4>checkout</h4>

<p><code>
alias ck='git checkout'
</code></p>

<h4>checkout branch develop</h4>

<p><code>
alias dev='git checkout develop'
</code></p>

<h4>checkout branch master</h4>

<p><code>
alias master='git checkout master'
</code></p>

<h4>create a new branch</h4>

<p><code>
alias ckb='git checkout -b'
</code></p>

<h4>push</h4>

<p><code>
alias push='git push'
</code></p>

<h4>force push after a rebase</h4>

<p><code>
alias pushf='git push -f'
</code></p>

<h4>pull</h4>

<p><code>
alias pull='git pull'
</code></p>

<h4>sync main branches</h4>

<p><code>
alias align='git pull --rebase origin master &amp;&amp; git pull --rebase origin develop'
</code></p>

<h4>fetch</h4>

<p><code>
alias fetch='git fetch'
</code></p>

<h4>commit</h4>

<p><code>
alias ci='git commit'
</code></p>

<h4>tag</h4>

<p><code>
alias tag='git tag'
</code></p>

<h4>revert all changes</h4>

<p><code>
alias undo='git reset --hard HEAD'
</code></p>

<h4>delete merged branch</h4>

<p>How many times do you have so many branches in your local repo that are already merged?
Let&rsquo;s get rid of them!
<code>
alias dmb='git branch --merged | xargs git branch -d'
</code></p>

<h4>log</h4>

<p><code>
alias glog='git log --oneline --decorate'
</code></p>

<h4>status</h4>

<p>A shorter version:
<code>
alias st='git status -sb'
</code></p>

<h4>diff</h4>

<p>This only highlights the changed words, nicely inline.
<code>
alias gdiff='git diff --word-diff'
</code></p>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>You messed up with a merge/rebase? Don&rsquo;t freak out, just use <code>git reflog</code> to check the local history command and sha1, and then <code>git reset --hard &lt;sha1&gt;</code></li>
<li>After rebasing develop in your feature branch you end up with too many conflicts and messed up commits history? Don&rsquo;t panic, create a new feature branch from develop and
<code>git cherry-pick</code> all the commits you need from your previous feature branch.</li>
<li>Is my commit already on branch X? <code>git branch --contains &lt;sha1&gt;</code> is there to rescue you!</li>
<li>You want to fetch a file from another branch without changing your current branch? <code>git checkout &lt;other_branch_name&gt; -- path/to/file</code></li>
</ul>


<p> Here you can find a complete list of <a href="https://gist.github.com/cirpo/86d43ef8ef87b4cfd031">aliases</a>, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/cirpo/343376f1ac7fb00204a0">here</a> the global .gitconfig we are using</p>

<p>If you have ever heard of Event Sourcing&hellip;</p>

<p>If you get excited everytime someone names Redis (even if it&rsquo;s for no apparent reason at all, the important is to get excited regardless)&hellip;</p>

<p>If you know the 5 tenets of the REST architectural style&hellip;</p>

<p>if you want to give back to the <a href="https://github.com/namshi">opensource community</a></p>

<p>If you like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawarma">shawarma</a>&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;if all of this and that, then think of coming over to Dubai to join
a startup that has been disruptive in his market and has been writing
a Service-Oriented Architecture (with <a href="http://www.styleisnecessity.com/2012/12/15/namshi-2/">style</a>! :&ndash;))
based on Symfony2, HTTP APIs and Redis.</p>

<p>We are looking for a <em>Senior API engineer</em>, and will offer a competitive
retribution plus some other benefits (<a href="/images/cirpo.png">working with cirpo</a>, among others).</p>

<h2>Frontend ducktyper</h2>

<p>As a <em>Senior Frontend Engineer</em>, you will need to get bored with old school
technologies like <strong>NodeJS, AngularJS, Gulp</strong>, on which our frontends are
currently running (to be honest, if we had to rewrite today, we would go
for PERL, #FORSURE).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, your duties will also include having to deal with the DevTools
in order to speed up performances and eliminate any waste and overengineering
we might have on our frontends.</p>

<p>Last but not least &ndash; I know, I&rsquo;m sorry :( &ndash; you will be disgusted to be consuming our backend APIs,
trying to get your head around HTTP headers, caching and everything bad about webservices.</p>

<p>Ah, I almost forgot to mention that we might have to add SPDY and WebP. Yesterday.</p>

<h2>About Namshi</h2>

<p>We honestly want to keep it cool and fun, that&rsquo;s why I wante to give this
post this kind of tone.</p>

<p>One thing I am really proud of, at Namshi, is that <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/soa-with-symfony2-confoo-2014-in-montreal-ca/159">we don&rsquo;t stick to one
technology</a> just because we think that we can do everything with it, we use the
correct technology for each and every context. <strong>We use what makes sense</strong>, which
means that even PERL could do something, one day, in our architecture.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d like to hire someone who relies on the community around him, who likes
to write open source code (and use it as well!), someone who likes enterprise
design patterns and is afraid every time a feature not covered by a test goes to production.</p>

<p>The team has been steadily growing since I joined the company in 2012,
both from an headcount perspective and the level of skills.</p>

<p>Our guys and girls tend to have fun on a daily basis, commit to the company
values (and to github as well!) and (I hope :-P) are having a great run
with technologies that is not always possible to use in other scenarios.</p>

<p>But we are also aware that without other points of view, without growth,
without some fresh energy, our journey to perfection would be even harder
(and I personally make it even harder, I know!).</p>

<p>Even though we are happy with our stack and what we achieved so far, we&rsquo;re aware that
we are far from being perfect: that&rsquo;s why we need <strong>you</strong> :)</p>

<p>Drop us an email (<code>alessandro.nadalin@namshi.com</code>) and let&rsquo;s have fun together!</p>
