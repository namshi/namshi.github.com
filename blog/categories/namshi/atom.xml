    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Folks, time for a quick one!</p>

<p><a href="https://connect.sensiolabs.com/profile/javier.eguiluz">Javier</a>
from SensioLabs was kind enough to ask whether we had some
interesting feedbacks about using Symfony2 in an SOA, and
that led to writing a small write-up about our experience.</p>

<p>So, head over to the Symfony blog to read how things
are panning out after <a href="http://symfony.com/blog/going-soa-with-symfony2-a-year-and-a-half-down-the-road">a year and a half of SOA with
Symfony2</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As our herd of node.js apps grows, we soon needed a way to keep an eye on them.
Having already in out tool belt a <a href="http://www.graylog2.org/">graylog2</a> facility in place, looking for a way to leverage it was the most natural thing to do.</p>

<p>Because of its nice modular <code>transports feature</code> our node-logging weapon of choice is <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/winston">winston</a>, the <code>graylog2</code> transport library looked a bit alone though and in need of a maintainer.
I our usual <strong>give back</strong> spirit we choose to adopt the lib instead of publishing a new one, and today we merged our 1st PR! :)</p>

<p>As for now our intervention was isolated to move away from the custom GELF protocol implementation, relying instead on the <a href="https://github.com/Wizcorp/node-graylog2">node-graylog2</a> library:
they&rsquo;ll most likely do a better job than us on the protocol side, and we&rsquo;ll be able to focus more on the winston integration.
We also started introducing some basic tests: definitely some better work can be done on this side ;)</p>

<p>So here it is: <a href="https://github.com/namshi/winston-graylog2">winston-graylog2</a>
and here&rsquo;s briefly how you use it:</p>

<p>the usual
<code>bash
npm install winston-graylog2
</code>
and then</p>

<p>```javascript
  var winston = require(&lsquo;winston&rsquo;);
  winston.add(require(&lsquo;winston-graylog2&rsquo;), options);</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>```javascript
var WinstonGraylog2 = require(&lsquo;winston-graylog2&rsquo;);
var logger = new(winston.Logger)({</p>

<pre><code>    exitOnError: false,
    transports: [new(WinstonGraylog2)(options)]
  });
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Enjoy! :)</p>

<p>Publishing something new is always a great feeling, and it&rsquo;s even more fulfilling when it involves not letting a project die :)<br> So let us know if you like it and share the love with some RP!!!! ;)</p>

you definitely don&rsquo;t want to miss the
<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/">PHP North East</a>
conference, which has an amazing lineup of
<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/speakers">speakers</a>
and <a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/speakers/view/176/Alessandro-Cinelli">a surprise</a>
from Dubai.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://2014.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cirpo.jpeg">http://2014.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cirpo.jpeg</a>" width="250"></p>

<p>Among the plethora of <a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/agenda">interesting talks</a>
there will be a (definitely) fun one, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.northeastphp.org/talks/view/352/PHP-is-the-king-nodejs-is-the-prince-and-Lua-is-the-fool">PHP is the king, NodeJS the price and Lua
is the fool</a>&rdquo;
given by our <a href="http://tech.namshi.io/team/#Alessandro%20Cinelli%20(cirpo)">Cirpo</a> who will entertain the crowd with some
details on how we mesh a whole lot of languages and platforms
together.</p>

<p>Namshi&rsquo;s SOA is currently running on at least 4 different
application platforms and Cirpo took the opportunity to share some insights
about how we are doing it: it will be a <em>hands-on</em> talk focused on
decision-making, benefits and pitfalls of running such a heterogeneous
architecture and how crazy ideas (like flirting with Lua) could be a
game-changer in your next long-term project.</p>

<p>Cirpo is no newbie to the world of speaking, as he already delivered
a few talks in the past and, <a href="https://joind.in/user/view/956">judging by the ratings</a>,
has a track record of nothing but success. Being a leader, at Namshi, doesn&rsquo;t mean
to only set the tone for our team, but also to confront with the community,
explain (and validate) our infrastructure and learn from the feedbacks we get back:
Cirpo knows that very well and this will be a great experience from this
standpoint.</p>

<p>We wish him a safe trip to the U.S. and wish <strong>you</strong> can
attend his talk!</p>

    <updated>2014-06-07T00:50:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2014/06/07/reconfi-declarative-javascript-configurations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We recently published a new library that let&rsquo;s you
deal with configurations, in JavaScript, in a very
elegant way.</p>

<p>The library is called <a href="https://github.com/namshi/reconfig">Reconfig</a> and it&rsquo;s available
through <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/reconfig">NPM</a> (if you need on the browser we highly
recommend <a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a>): it&rsquo;s really
small and simple, and thought to keep your
configuration as elegant, simple and declarative as possible.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>With reconfig you can do stuff like:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <pre><code class='language-javascript'>

var reconfig = require(&amp;lsquo;reconfig&amp;rsquo;);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var config =  new reconfig({&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;greet: &apos;Hello :who!&apos;,
sayhi: &apos;{{ greet }}&apos;
countries: {
    uae: {
        population: &apos;2M&apos;,
        nationalDay: &apos;December 2nd&apos;
    }
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;});&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Retrieve a deep config value
config.get(&amp;lsquo;countries.uae.nationalDay&amp;rsquo;); // December, 2nd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Pass parameters to the configuration
config.get(&amp;lsquo;greet&amp;rsquo;, {who: &amp;lsquo;John&amp;rsquo;}); // Hello, John!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Reference other configuration parameters
config.get(&amp;lsquo;sayhi&amp;rsquo;, {who: &amp;lsquo;John&amp;rsquo;}); // Hello, John!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Fallback values
config.get(&amp;lsquo;something&amp;rsquo;, {}, &amp;lsquo;invalid&amp;rsquo;); // invalid

</code></pre></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re probably gonna look into porting the same to
PHP (another big player in our stack) so&hellip;stay tuned!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you like Java? Ok, I possibly started from the wrongest question.</p>

<p>Restart.</p>

<p>Do you like Android? (sounds much better!) And what about iOS? Tablets?
Mobile devices in general? If so, come over and let&rsquo;s change the way
people shop in the Middle East.</p>

<p>We are looking for a <strong>Lead Mobile Developer</strong>, someone who can get his hands
dirty with both of the main platforms, and teach others how to do it: we&rsquo;d
like you to bring in your expertise and help kicking off our mobile
development team.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What do we need?</h2>

<p>Our need is to kickoff an internal development team, which could even be split by
iOS and Android, and to do so we would need to make a first, very good hire and
find a lead who can drive all the way to success.</p>

<p>How will your typical day look like? You will go over a <a href="https://gist.github.com">gist</a> which has the specs for
a feature together with the other leads, wrap up a bugfix for the next release,
check one of the pull requests submitted by another team member and have
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Shawarma_ad_Istanbul_(01.10.2008).JPG">lotsa shawarma</a> for lunch.</p>

<p>As general rules, we would like:</p>

<ul>
<li>someone who speaks both <strong>Android and iOS</strong> (if you know only one of them but think you deserve a position, talk to us and we&rsquo;d be very happy to hear your point)</li>
<li>a few years of proficient <strong>development of mobile applications</strong>, possibly being a leader of a small/mid-sized team</li>
<li>knowledge of the <strong>latest trend</strong> in your technical sector (you tell us if <a href="http://www.omgchrome.com/android-webview-auto-update-future/">android auto-updates its webview component</a>, not the other way round :) as well as suggesting tools like <a href="http://hockeyapp.net/features/">Hockey</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Object-Oriented design</strong>: sounds boring but we don&rsquo;t limit ourselves to MVC, we actually need you to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/odino/dont-screw-it-up-how-to-build-durable-web-apis-phpday-2014-in-verona-ita">consume our APIs and get the most out of them</a></li>
<li>it would be a plus to get someone who is passionate about <strong>OSS</strong> and would like to release some of our stuff after polishing them for the public</li>
</ul>


<h2>What do we offer?</h2>

<ul>
<li>a good salary, we don&rsquo;t want to hire people who feel they&rsquo;ve been underpaid</li>
<li>SPDY, HTTP APIs and a Service-Oriented Architecture</li>
<li>a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/First+Gulf+Bank+Metro+Station+1+-+Sheikh+Zayed+Rd+-+Dubai+-+United+Arab+Emirates/More+Cafe+Gold+%26+Diamond+Park+-+Sheikh+Zayed+Rd+-+Dubai+-+United+Arab+Emirates/@25.1264065,55.2068206,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f6bc621973f29:0x18a89384f349bdf6!2m2!1d55.207756!2d25.126699!1m5!1m1!1s0x3e5f6bc6122edfe3:0x435be27ccd3d1564!2m2!1d55.208316!2d25.126114!3e2">1-minute-walk</a> from the metro to the office</li>
<li>a <a href="/team">great team</a></li>
<li>you <strong>will and won&rsquo;t</strong> be alone: our team is made of ~15 software engineers and we share best practices at the architectual / software design level,
but don&rsquo;t have a way to re-invent the current team members into mobile hackers</li>
<li>growth, as mobile is getting bigger and bigger (for us and for the ecommerce market in general): we expect the mobile
development team to be growing as months will go by</li>
<li>a company which is standing on the <a href="http://www.rocket-internet.de/">shoulder of giants</a></li>
<li>the <em>&ldquo;10th our breakpoint&rdquo;</em>: if you work for 10 hours then have a break, order food and we will reimburse it</li>
<li>working with <a href="http://instagram.com/p/gpSOCenpPI/">these two guys</a></li>
</ul>
